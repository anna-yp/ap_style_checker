We are making our first change in our primary dictionary in decades, now turning to Merriam-Webster as our first source. We don't take such a switch lightly, as AP style is informed by the spelling and styling recommended by our main dictionary. In recent years, we have seen that Merriam-Webster is more up to date and more in line with our approach. In making the change to our new primary dictionary, we carefully compared our guidance with Merriam-Webster's. We believe that a stylebook is different from a dictionary, and in doing this comparison, we eliminated many terms already listed in Merriam-Webster. We believe strongly that writers and editors need both a stylebook and a dictionary, so we recommend you use your AP Stylebook in concert with the Merriam-Webster dictionary for the most complete guidance. New chapters: Criminal Justice chapter: This new chapter gives extensive guidance on many issues related to crime and criminal justice coverage, including language; mug shots and other photos; graphic material; issues with initial reports by police and others; interviewing victims and family members; source development; and accountability journalism. It also pulls together entries that previously were listed individually throughout the book, and updates several of them. New guidance includes the term child sexual abuse images (not child porn ); the terms used for people who are or were in prison or jail; the terms juvenile and minor ; and the terms sex work and sex workers . We now say the terms assault weapons or assault rifles may be used in headlines and in first reference because that is how the group of firearms has become commonly known. But high in the story, give specifics about the types of guns at issue in any given law or story. We also updated guidance on the term Taser . Artificial Intelligence chapter: Provides caveats and best practices about covering artificial intelligence. For example: Don't use language that attributes human characteristics to generative AI tools. Be aware that these tools often can be wrong or basically make things up. Be aware that they are trained by people with inherent biases that can affect the responses given by these bots. Also, 11 key AI-related terms with definitions and explanations. Technology chapter: Pulls together terms and guidance related to technology and social media that previously had appeared individually throughout the book. Many of those terms have been updated. Among the updates: We've loosened the restrictions on use of the term cyberattack . And we now say to avoid the terms tweet or tweeted . Instead: posted on the social platform X or posted on X . In addition, we made a number of updates to the Social Media Reporting chapter. Two new sections: Digital journalism: Describes best practices in digital journalism and storytelling. For example: All elements that feed into a story, photo or video — from the headline to the SEO title to the social graphic for Instagram — should be viewed as an act of journalism and meet the standards set by your newsroom. Checklist for self-editing (and for reporting and writing): Lists pointers to help make your reporting and writing much stronger and make basic editing more thorough before reaching the editor's desk. Highlights of other new or revised entries: Climate change, climate crisis: Revised guidance allows the term climate crisis , in addition to climate change , in broad references to the general state of the climate. The entry gives details on when one term or the other is better, and says to use the term climate crisis sparingly. We also added a number of terms, including community solar , direct air capture and energy transition . Race-related coverage: Updated guidance says to generally use the term Native Americans in broad references when referring to two or more people of different tribal affiliations within the contiguous U.S. geographic boundaries. The term Indigenous people(s) is a broad umbrella term, describing the original inhabitants of a place globally. The term does not capture the political relationship or political status of Native American tribes or people, so use it only when the broad description is accurate. Be specific about a person's citizenship and/or affiliation. The term American Indians is generally considered outdated. The guidance gives additional detail on these terms and other language considerations. Also in the race-related coverage entry: new guidance that locs is our style for a rope-like hairstyle that is a common protective hairstyle among Black people. Specify dreadlocks , dreads when referring to people with the hairstyle who are of Jamaican descent or Rastafarian belief. Locks refers to hair in general. Gender, sex and sexual orientation: New guidance to avoid using male and female as modifiers that could convey assumptions about gender roles, such as male nurse , male nanny , female bodybuilder . Revised guidance on the term bisexual . (See the 2023 section below for more updates in this umbrella entry.) Obesity: A new entry notes that people with obesity , people of higher weights and people who prefer the term fat use diverse terms — including those and others — in reference to themselves. Use care and precision, considering the impact of specific words and the terms used by the people you are writing about. When possible, ask people how they want to be described. The phrasing people with obesity or a person with obesity is acceptable when a general term is needed and is relevant, unless a group or person prefers other terms. Avoid the modifier obese when possible. Crisis hotlines: We now say AP stories may include publishable editor's notes with detail about crisis hotlines in stories about suicide, sexual assault, domestic violence, mental illness, substance abuse and other topics. Suicide: Additions to previous guidance, including more details on crisis hotlines. Homelessness: Updated guidance notes that some advocates and others prefer the term unhoused in an effort to focus on a person's lack of shelter. However, people without homes may have some sort of housing. So use unhoused only when quoting people, if an organization uses the term or if people use it for themselves. As with the homeless , avoid the term the unhoused . Terrorism: This revised guidance says AP is not using the terms terrorism or terrorist for specific actions, people or groups, other than in direct quotations or when attributed to authorities or others. Instead, we describe specific atrocities, massacres, bombings, assassinations and other such actions. Numerals intro: An expanded introduction gives more details on when, in general, to use figures rather than words for 1 through 9 . That includes ages (of people, animals, events or things), and when preceding a unit of measure (inches, pounds, miles, quarts, temperature degrees, etc.) — except for time measurements such as seconds, days, years, etc. Generally spell out zero , though the figure 0 may be appropriate in technical contexts or in ranges. Note there are no changes in style, which calls for generally spelling out one through nine except as noted in the extended guidance. The entry also retains the other individual situations (addresses, court rulings, etc.) in which we use figures rather than words for 1 through 9 . Prefixes: Revised entry pulls together in one section the prefixes (except those related to measurements) that previously had been listed separately. A 2024 change: We no longer generally use a hyphen with these prefixes: out- , post- , pre- , re- . This change aligns style on those prefixes both with our overall guidance and with Merriam-Webster. Another 2024 change: no hyphen in semiautomatic and semiautonomous , adding those to the other no-hyphen semi- constructions. Suffixes: Revised entry pulls together in one section the suffixes that previously had been listed separately. Lists, bulleted lists: Revised guidance says that while AP continues to use dashes instead of bullets to introduce individual sections of a list in news stories, we now may use bullets in other formats.That expands on previous guidance that bullets are always an option for non-AP content in all formats. The revision also says to use no punctuation at the end of a single word or single phrase in each section of a list, but use a period after a sentence in a bulleted item. We previously said to use a period in all cases, including after phrases or single words in a list. So-called: Revised guidance recommends avoiding so-called , which can be seen as mocking or derogatory. Instead, use more words: what are often known as; what are sometimes known as; what supporters call; what opponents call , etc. Designated days, weeks, months: New entry says to capitalize all words in the name of a designated or branded day, week, month or other time period: Black History Month, Mental Health Awareness Month, World Religion Day, International Women's Day . Lowercase the time period in informal descriptions: Memorial Day weekend, Christmas week . Lying in state: Revised guidance says that while only people who are entitled to a state funeral may formally lie in state, the term is sometimes used informally by government leaders and is generally acceptable. Media: Revised entry recommends avoiding writing in a way that implies media are monolithic. Be specific when referring to, for example, news media, social media or paid media. Refer to specific organizations or companies individually when relevant. Abortion: Added guidance to be specific when possible about the details of a person's or group's beliefs or positions. Weather event: New entry says that when possible, avoid this term and instead be specific if the reference is to a specific flood, landslide, mudslide, hurricane, etc. UFOs, UAPs: New entry discusses use of the term unidentified anomalous phenomena , or UAPs , for what have long been called UFOs , short for unidentified flying objects . Sexually transmitted disease, sexually transmitted infection: New entry discusses use of these terms and the shorthand STD(s) and STI(s) . Quotations in the news: Addition to this entry advises to in general, use the verb said . The verb announced is acceptable when referring to an announcement. Generally avoid wording such as claimed, admitted, conceded , etc., which can sound loaded or judgmental. The entry gives additional guidance on attribution. Unique: Revised guidance says it's OK to describe something as very unique when the sense is highly unusual, rare , etc. But don't use very unique when the sense is one of a kind . 2023 updates made on AP Stylebook Online and now in the print book: Expanded guidance on climate change and the climate crisis , with new entries such as carbon dioxide, carbon footprint, desertification and greenwashing . New philanthropy terms including nonprofit vs. not-for-profit , GivingTuesday , LYBUNT and crowdfunding . A change in AP style from LGBTQ to LGBTQ+ to make it more inclusive. Also updates on deadnaming , queer , transgender and other gender-related terms and points. Expanded guidance on the right and wrong uses of the term Hawaiian(s) . A new entry on the Civil Rights Movement , which should be capitalized when referring to the specific historical period in the U.S. mainly in the 1950s and '60s. A change to capitalize the Hajj , the pilgrimage to Mecca. Guidance that the names Czechia and the Czech Republic are both acceptable. The addition of B.C.E. and C.E. as acceptable options, in addition to B.C. and A.D. A new entry on euthanasia, medically assisted suicide, physician-assisted suicide that spells out proper usage for each term. A new sequential designations section of the numerals entry. Revised guidance on the word incident . Revision to delete the hyphen from G7 and G20 . Deletions: We have removed some material from the print book to make room for new guidance. Sports agate examples are now only on Stylebook Online. The Media Law chapter is online only. Most company names and details, as well as the Digital Security for Journalists chapter, have been deleted."}
{"source_url": "https://www.apstylebook.com/ap_stylebook/about-the-ap", "entry_header": "About the AP", "text_content": "Since 1846, The Associated Press has been on the scene wherever news is breaking. AP is a not-for-profit newsgathering cooperative whose content — across subjects, formats and continents — is seen by 4 billion people every day. Our unmatched expertise in global newsgathering, distribution and service makes AP the most trusted, definitive source for news. The AP’s mission is to advance the power of factual reporting, by providing fast, accurate, nonpartisan journalism from every corner of the globe across all media types and platforms. Headquartered in New York, AP delivers coverage of news, sports, business, weather, entertainment, politics, lifestyles and technology in text, audio, video, graphics, photos and interactives. AP is also the essential provider of the technology and services vital to the news business. With journalists in nearly 250 locations in 100 countries, AP is committed to on-the-ground reporting, including in the world’s most dangerous and challenging places. In the U.S., AP maintains an unrivaled footprint with journalists in every statehouse providing access to information and newsmakers. The extensive network that is the AP grew from a single notion more than a century and a half ago: Cooperation can help authoritative news reach readers faster. In late 1846, hostilities began in what would become the Mexican War. American newspapers, most based in the Northeast at the time, faced huge obstacles in reporting the conflict. War reports for the New York Sun were sent from Mexico to Mobile, Alabama, by boat, rushed by special pony express to Montgomery and then 700 miles by U.S. Mail stagecoach to the southern terminus of the newly invented telegraph near Richmond, Virginia. That express gave the Sun an edge of 24 hours or more on papers using regular mail. But Moses Yale Beach, the Sun’s publisher, relinquished that advantage by inviting other New York publishers to join a cooperative venture that would avoid duplication of effort by sending one so-called agent, or newsgatherer, to act for the many. Five newspapers signed on: the Sun, the Journal of Commerce, the Courier and Enquirer, the Herald and the Express. It was the beginning of the AP. AP assumed its modern legal form in 1900 when it incorporated as a not-for-profit cooperative under the Membership Corporation Law of New York state. Today, the AP membership elects the board of directors, the cooperative’s governing body. Today, the AP membership elects a board of directors to provide corporate direction according to AP bylaws. AP staffers are governed by a comprehensive ethics statement, available for viewing at https://www.ap.org/about/our-story/news-values More than 175 years since its inception, AP remains the undisputed source for news, delivering fast, unbiased news globally to all media platforms and formats."}
{"source_url": "https://www.apstylebook.com/ap_stylebook/stylebook-how-we-do-it", "entry_header": "Stylebook: how we do it", "text_content": "“The English language is fluid and changes incessantly. What last year may have been very formal, next year may be loosely informal. Word combinations, slogans and phrases are being added to and becoming part of the language. ... “Because of the constantly changing usage, no compilation can be called permanent. Nor can any one volume be infallible or contain all the wisdom and information of the ages.” That’s what AP editors observed in introducing the first version of the AP Stylebook in 1953. We say the same today. Or, as a modern-day Stylebook subscriber put it: In a lot of ways, the Stylebook is a history book of sorts, a real-time reflection on the times in which we live. Through all the changes in the world through the years, our work remains deeply rooted in respect for language and commitment to the goals of AP journalism in general: to be accurate, clear, fair and concise. We’re a combination of prescriptivist (rules rules rules) and descriptivist — capturing and conveying how the language is used, and adding some guidance around that. There’s not always a definitive right or wrong. Some of our guidance offers key points to consider in choosing language, and notes that there can be a lot of gray areas. Often, writers and editors may need to make judgment calls based on in-depth discussion and consideration. Since AP style is grounded in guiding AP journalists, our approach considers a very broad audience, from all sorts of backgrounds, in cities large and small around the globe. We aim to make our guidance easy to apply for those outside the AP as well. But organizations, writers and editors who aren’t with the AP can modify it as needed for their own audiences. The core Stylebook team consists of a lead editor plus other editors from a variety of backgrounds. At this writing, we are: lead editor Paula Froke, also a manager on AP’s Standards and Style team; Anna Jo Bratton, U.S. enterprise editor; Jeff McMillan, an editor on AP’s U.S. Desk; and Pia Sarkar, deputy business news editor for enterprise and storytelling. Managers on AP’s Standards and Style team weigh in on some issues. AP’s senior news leaders make the final call on the biggest or most sensitive guidance. We consult regularly with AP reporters and editors who are experts in the fields they cover. We do a great deal of research. We confer with people and organizations outside the AP. Often our AP specialists write the first drafts of our guidance — whether it’s a single entry or an entire chapter — and work with us to revise and refine. We get ideas for additions or changes from all over. Many come from those of us on the team, based on what we see and read in the world around us. Others on the AP staff regularly make suggestions. We get many ideas from our social media followers. Questions to Stylebook Online’s Ask the Editor feature and a separate suggestions link often point to a need for a new entry, or changes to existing entries. Organizations and regular readers email with ideas. From all of that, we assess what we believe would be of the greatest broad interest or importance or usefulness. For much of the year, the core Stylebook team meets once or twice a week by Zoom to discuss ideas for guidance, or drafts of new guidance, or proposals to change or delete existing guidance. Between the meetings, we review drafts in a shared document and do more research with experts inside and outside the AP. Our discussions consider many points, including the need to be inclusive and respectful in our storytelling. We monitor the evolution of language and society, while avoiding calls for us to jump on every possible change that comes our way. We carefully consider the perspectives offered in comments made directly to us and in commentary and factual stories from a diversity of sources. We also consider our very wide variety of users — far beyond our original scope of straight-news journalists — and their even broader variety of readers. We discuss at length every proposal, including those that appear to be fairly straightforward. Often those discussions extend for days, weeks, months or more. We revise, revise again, revise some more, discuss some more, and revise and revise again. Once we make our updates public, we pay close attention to the feedback. Nothing, of course, is universally applauded. The reaction — both positive and negative — can be intense. Generally, the comments are points that we’ve already considered and discussed. At times, though, we will get feedback that causes us to revise again — even after all the thinking and talking we’ve already done. “The end result of extensive exploration and consultation in this work necessarily represents many compromises between conflicting points of view,” the editors noted in 1953. We say that today as well. Paula Froke AP Stylebook editor"}

{"source_url": "https://www.apstylebook.com/ap_stylebook/foreword", "entry_header": "FOREWORD", "text_content": "When The Associated Press Stylebook was introduced in 1953, it was a 60-page guide focused on matters of capitalization, punctuation, grammar and spelling. The audience was reporters and editors with the AP, a not-for-profit newsgathering cooperative whose journalists today break news and cover the world’s biggest stories through words and compelling visuals. Today’s Stylebook, at more than 500 pages, serves not only journalists within AP and beyond, but also communicators in a wide variety of fields and publications. We still outline basic rules or guidance on grammar, punctuation, word usage and journalistic style, and strive to reflect changes in common usage. But we have evolved to also offer guidelines on a number of significant topics of our times. Among them: race, gender, climate change, addiction, immigration, disabilities, sexual misconduct and more. We also have added chapters on inclusive storytelling, artificial intelligence, criminal justice, religion, health and science, polls and surveys, technology, and data journalism. While we remain committed to our classic, practical, spiral-bound edition — now published every other year — AP Stylebook Online has become the primary way professional writers and editors access this definitive resource. With the shift to a digital environment, our online format allows AP Stylebook to remain a fundamental and easily accessible guide. It is constantly updated to reflect changes in real time. A team of top AP editors meets throughout the year to make updates and improvements, many of which appear immediately in Stylebook Online. Contributions come from the AP staff, AP's member news organizations and subscribers, journalism teachers and students, specialists in a host of fields, and everyday readers. Indeed, some of the changes that are talked about most have come at the suggestion of Stylebook followers on social media. We are honored to help writers and editors in all fields in their commitment to clear, fair and concise writing. DAISY VEERASINGHAM President and CEO"}

{"source_url": "https://www.apstylebook.com/ap_stylebook/disabilities", "entry_header": "disabilities", "text_content": "The terms disabilities and disabled include a broad range of physical, psychological, developmental and intellectual conditions both visible and invisible. Perceptions of disabilities vary widely. Language about disabilities is both wide-ranging and evolving. Disabled people are not monolithic. They use diverse terms to describe themselves. Many, for example, use the term people with disabilities . Both people with disabilities and disabled people are acceptable terms, but try to determine the preference of a person or group. Use care and precision, considering the impact of specific words and the terms used by the people you are writing about. When possible, ask people how they want to be described. Be mindful that the question of identity-first vs. person-first language is vital for many. The terms disabilities and disabled are generally embraced by disabled people and are acceptable when relevant. Do not use euphemisms such as handi-capable , differently abled or physically challenged , other than in direct quotations or in explaining how an individual describes themself. Do not use handicap for a disability or handicapped for a person. Limit use of the term disorder other than in the names of specific conditions, as well as words such as impairment, abnormality and special . In general, refer to a disability only if relevant to the story, and if a medical diagnosis has been made or the person uses the term. If relatives or others use the term, ask how they know, then consider carefully whether to include the information. Avoid writing that implies ableism: the belief that abilities of people who aren’t disabled are superior. Ableism is a concept similar to racism, sexism and ageism in that it includes stereotypes, generalizations, and demeaning views and language. It is a form of discrimination or prejudice against people with disabilities. Don’t limit coverage of disabled people to coverage of disabilities. People with disabilities are experts in as many fields as nondisabled people are. Include their voices and their images in your regular coverage of any topic. Avoid “inspiration porn” — stories or photos meaning to portray something positive or uplifting, with the unintended implication that a disability is negative and that disabled people are objects of pity or wonder. If a disability is pertinent to the story, provide brief details explaining that relevance. For example: Merritt, who is blind and walks with the help of a guide dog, said she is pleased with the city’s walkway improvements. Feldman said the airline kicked her family off a plane after her 3-year-old refused to wear a mask. She said the mask refusal relates to her son’s autism. But not: Zhang, who has paraplegia, is a fan of the Philadelphia Phillies. Some people use person-first language in describing themselves: a man with Down syndrome or a woman with schizophrenia . Others view their disability as central to their identity and use identity-first language , such as an autistic woman or deaf students . Autistic people and deaf people often — but not always — use identity-first language . When preferences of an individual or group can’t be determined, try to use a mix of person-first and identity-first language . Avoid using disability-related words lightly or in unrelated situations, and avoid direct quotations using such wording unless essential to the story. Some examples: calling a person or an idea demented, psychotic, lame, blind, catatonic, moronic, retarded, on the spectrum , etc. Other examples: saying the warning falls on deaf ears; he turned a blind eye; the awards show is schizophrenic; she accused the group of foot-dragging or he said leaders are dragging their feet . As in all writing, consider word choice carefully. Words that seem innocuous to some people can have specific and deeply personal or offensive meanings to others. Alternative phrasing is almost always possible. Do not write in a way that implies a person’s condition or disability is related to a crime or other wrongdoing unless that link has been firmly established by experts in the specific case and is explained in the story. Other language or constructions not to use: — Words that suggest pity, such as afflicted with, battling or suffers from any disability or illness, or that a person overcame her disability. Instead: has cancer, being treated for ADHD . Bear in mind that disabilities can be a combination of both challenges and assets. Generally avoid living with constructions unless a person uses that for themself. — Cliches such as inspiring and brave . — Dehumanizing mass terms such as the disabled, the blind, the mentally ill , etc. As with all writing, avoid broad generalizations, labels and stereotypes. — Terms such as normal or typical for someone who does not have a disability. Instead: People without a disability, nondisabled . Use care in deciding whether to use the term able-bodied , although the term has specific meaning in contexts such as some government reports and is appropriate in such references. — Negative or condescending language such as wheelchair-bound or Alzheimer’s victim . Instead use accurate, neutral language such as uses a wheelchair or a person with Alzheimer’s disease .

Some others are acceptable, depending on the context. But in general, avoid alphabet soup. Do not use abbreviations or acronyms that the reader would not quickly recognize. Avoid abbreviations and most acronyms in headlines, except those that are widely recognizable ( FBI, EU, US, CIA, IRS, NASA, NATO, COVID , for example). Guidance on how to use a particular abbreviation or acronym is provided in entries alphabetized according to the sequence of letters in the word or phrase. An acronym is a word formed from the first letter or letters of a series of words: laser ( light amplification by stimulated emission of radiation ). An abbreviation is not an acronym . Some general principles: BEFORE A NAME: Abbreviate titles when used before a full name: Dr., Gov., Lt. Gov., Rep., the Rev., Sen. and certain military designations listed in the military titles entry. For guidelines on how to use titles, see courtesy titles ; legislative titles ; military titles ; religious titles ; and the entries for the most commonly used titles. AFTER A NAME: Abbreviate junior or senior after an individual’s name. Abbreviate company, corporation, incorporated and limited when used after the name of a corporate entity. See entries under these words and company names . In some cases, an academic degree may be abbreviated after an individual’s name. See academic degrees . WITH DATES OR NUMERALS: Use the abbreviations A.D., B.C. (or C.E., B.C.E. ), a.m., p.m., No. , and abbreviate certain months (Jan., Feb., Aug., Sept., Oct., Nov., Dec.) when used with the day of the month. Right: In 450 B.C.; at 9:30 a.m.; in room No. 6; on Sept. 16 . Wrong: Early this a.m. he asked for the No. of your room . The abbreviations are correct only with figures. Right: Early this morning he asked for the number of your room . See months and individual entries for these other terms: IN NUMBERED ADDRESSES: Abbreviate avenue, boulevard and street in numbered addresses: He lives on Pennsylvania Avenue. He lives at 1600 Pennsylvania Ave . See addresses . STATES: The names of certain states and the United States are abbreviated with periods in some circumstances. See state names ; datelines . AVOID AWKWARD CONSTRUCTIONS: Do not follow an organization’s full name with an abbreviation or acronym in parentheses or set off by dashes. If an abbreviation or acronym would not be clear on second reference without this arrangement, do not use it. Names not commonly before the public should not be reduced to acronyms solely to save a few words. SPECIAL CASES: Many abbreviations are desirable in tabulations and certain types of technical writing. See individual entries. CAPS, PERIODS: Use capital letters and periods according to the listings in this book. For words not in this book, use the first-listed abbreviation in Merriam-Webster. Generally, omit periods in acronyms unless the result would spell an unrelated word. But use periods in most two-letter abbreviations: U.S., U.N., U.K., B.A., B.C. ( AP , a trademark, is an exception. Also, no periods in GI, ID and EU , among others.) In headlines, do not use periods in abbreviations, unless required for clarity. Use all caps, but no periods, in longer abbreviations when the individual letters are pronounced: ABC, CIA, FBI . Use only an initial cap and then lowercase for abbreviations and acronyms of more than five letters, unless listed otherwise in this Stylebook or Merriam-Webster."}

{"source_url": "https://www.apstylebook.com/ap_stylebook/quotations-in-the-news", "entry_header": "quotations in the news", "text_content": "Never alter quotations even to correct minor grammatical errors or word usage. Casual minor tongue slips may be removed by using ellipses but even that should be done with extreme caution. Do not use ( sic ) to show that quoted material or person’s words include a misspelling, incorrect grammar or peculiar usage. (This is a change from previous guidance.) Instead, paraphrase if possible. If the quoted material is essential, simply use it as spoken or written, in line with the guidance below. In AP stories, use an editor’s note to confirm for other editors: Eds: The spelling “Cristina” instead of “Christina” in the ransom note is as the note reads . If there is a question about a quotation, either don’t use it or ask the speaker to clarify. If a person is unavailable for comment, detail attempts to reach that person. ( Agarwal was out of the country on business; Park did not return phone messages left at the office. ) Do not use substandard spellings such as gonna or wanna in attempts to convey regional dialects or informal pronunciations, except to convey an emphasis by the speaker. When quoting spoken words, present them in the format that reflects AP style: No. 1, St., Gov., $3 . But quotes should not be changed otherwise for reasons of style. If the speaker says towards , do not change it to toward . When quoting written words, retain the style used by the writer; do not alter the written words even if they don’t match AP style. Use quotations only if they are the best way to tell the story or convey meaning. Often, paraphrasing is preferable. In general, avoid using parenthetical clarifications in quoted material. If such a clarification is needed, it’s almost always better to paraphrase. If the quotation is essential, include the unclear word or phrase before the parenthetical clarification; deleting it creates questions in a reader’s mind. For example: “I heard him (the second attacker) yell, ‘The sky is falling! Chicken Little was right!’ before he drew the knife.” Not: “I heard (the second attacker) yell, ‘The sky is falling! Chicken Little was right!’ before he drew the knife.” Better: The witness said he heard the second attacker yell: “The sky is falling! Chicken Little was right!” before drawing the knife. In general, use the verb said . The verb announced is acceptable when referring to an announcement. Generally avoid wording such as claimed, admitted, conceded , etc., which can sound loaded or judgmental. In news stories, generally use the past tense. The present tense says may be appropriate in some stories, such as profiles, narratives or features, that aren’t hard news or breaking news, and in broadcast stories. Do not alternate between tenses within a story. Avoid verbs such as believes, hopes, fears, feels , etc., unless accompanied by attribution: She said (or says , in some stories) she hopes , not she hopes . The construction Fernandez said , rather than said Fernandez , is generally preferred. Use the latter if a long title is involved: … said Fernandez, vice president for human resources and employee concerns . FULL vs. PARTIAL QUOTATIONS: In general, avoid fragmentary quotations. If a speaker’s words are clear and concise, favor the full quotation. If cumbersome language can be paraphrased fairly, use an indirect construction, reserving quotation marks for sensitive or controversial passages that must be identified specifically as coming from the speaker. CONTEXT: Remember that you can misquote someone by giving a startling remark without its modifying passage or qualifiers. The manner of delivery sometimes is part of the context. Reporting a smile or a deprecatory gesture may be as important as conveying the words themselves. SOCIAL MEDIA POSTS AND TEXT MESSAGES: Social media posts and text messages often contain emoji , GIFs or other imagery that need to be conveyed to readers using words. Treat the visual material as context or gestures when important to include, describing by paraphrasing: Chavis sparked a flurry of responses against the airline after posting a GIF of large crowds at the gate, with the message “#missinghoneymoon” and an emoji string of a worried smiley, a ring, an hourglass and an umbrella propped on a beach. Be aware that some GIFs, emoji or other images may contain hidden meanings and nuances requiring consideration and more than just a simple description of the image posted. Do not use parentheses to describe an emoji within a direct quotation, to avoid confusing readers by making it seem as if the person being quoted wrote out the description in text. Many story platforms support displaying posts as they actually appear, or hyperlinking to posts on social networks, giving journalists several options to let readers see material for themselves. For example, some production systems may allow you to directly insert emoji into the text of a story. Additionally, most social networks allow for direct embedding of such material, and screen captures may also be acceptable if images are displayed in accordance with your newsroom’s visual standards.

{"source_url": "https://www.apstylebook.com/ap_stylebook/copyright-infringement", "entry_header": "Copyright infringement", "text_content": "Copyright infringement Copyright is the right of an author to control the reproduction and use of any creative expression that has been fixed in tangible form, such as on paper or computer disk. The right of Congress to pass laws protecting copyright is itself protected in the Constitution, and the First Amendment is generally not a defense to a valid claim for copyright infringement under the Copyright Act. The types of creative expression eligible for copyright protection include literary, graphic, photographic, audiovisual, electronic and musical works. In this context, “tangible forms” range from film to videotape to material posted on the internet. Personal letters or diaries may be protected by copyright even though they may not have been published and may not contain a copyright notice. Probably of greatest concern to reporters and editors are the copyrights in photographs and videos used to illustrate a news report. A copyright comes into existence the moment an original work of expression is captured in a tangible form. No government approval or filing is required for a work to be protected by copyright. Upon creation of the work, ownership of the copyright in that work is vested in the “author” of a work – the person to whom the work owes its origin. The owner will generally be the author of the work, or the photographer in the case of an image. Under certain circumstances, however, someone other than the person who actually created the work may be deemed to be the work's “author” and thereby own the copyright. Under the work made for hire doctrine, copyright ownership of a particular work vests with the employer of the author when the work is created by an employee who is acting within the scope of his or her employment. The owner of a copyright is given the exclusive right to reproduce, distribute, display and prepare “derivative works” of the copyright material. These rights exist for the life of the author plus 70 years. In the case of a “work for hire” owned by a corporation, the right exists for 95 years from the first publication or 120 years from creation, whichever is shorter. – Limitations on copyright Not all uses of copyright material constitute infringement. The most important limitation on the reach of copyright law for journalists is that ideas and facts are never protected by a copyright. What is protected by the copyright law is the manner of expression. The copyright pertains only to the literary, musical, graphic or artistic form in which an author expresses intellectual concepts. For example, an author's analysis or interpretation of events, the way the material is structured and the specific facts marshaled, the choice of particular words and the emphasis given to specific developments, may all be protected by copyright. The essence of a claim for copyright infringement lies not in taking a general theme or in covering specific events, but in appropriating particular expression through similarities of treatment, details, scenes, events and characterizations. This printed page illustrates the distinction between protected expression and nonprotected ideas and facts. Despite the copyright protecting this page, a subsequent author is free to report any of the facts it contains. The subsequent author may not, however, employ the same or essentially the same combination of words, structure, and tone, which constitute the expression of those facts. A second limitation on the reach of copyright is the doctrine of “fair use.”  This doctrine permits, in certain circumstances, the use of copyright material without its author's permission. Courts will invoke “fair use” when a rigid application of the copyright law would stifle the very creativity the law is designed to foster. To determine whether a particular use is “fair” and hence permitted, courts are required to evaluate and balance such factors as: (1) the purpose of the use; (2) the nature of the copyrighted work that is being used; (3) the amount and substantiality of the portion used in relation to the copyrighted work as a whole; and (4) the effect of the use upon the potential value of the copyrighted work. Courts generally consider how “transformative” the use is. Uses that can be said to have transformed portions of the original work into something entirely new by “altering the first [work] with new expression, meaning or message” would factor in to a fair use finding. (See Campbell v. Acuff-Rose Music Inc. ) Uses that merely supplant the work by presenting it essentially as it was in the original version tend not to be fair. News reporting, criticism and comment are favored purposes under the fair-use doctrine, but “scooping” a copyright holder's first use of previously unpublished material is not. Note, though, that “purpose” is only one of the fair-use factors. Thus, a use for a proper purpose may nevertheless constitute an infringement if other factors weigh against that use being fair. Here are some general guidelines to keep in mind when dealing with material written by others: Content created by the federal government is not protected by copyright, but content created by state and local governments may be. The greater the amount of the copyrighted work used, the less likely that a court will characterize the use as fair. The amount of use alone, however, is not necessarily decisive; courts have found uses not to be fair when the portion used was small but so important that it went to the heart of the copyrighted work. Uses that decrease any potential market for the copyrighted work weigh against a finding of fairness. For instance, if a literary critic reproduces all five lines of a five-line poem, the potential market for the poem will be diminished because any reader of the critic's piece can also obtain a copy of the poem for free. Reporters and editors having questions about whether their use in a news story or column of copyrighted material is a fair use should review these factors. No mathematical formula can yield the answer. Where there is a question as to whether a particular use is fair, consideration may be given to seeking permission (or a license) from the copyright owner. If a use is not “fair” within the meaning of copyright law, it will be no defense to claim the use of the copyrighted material was newsworthy and therefore protected by the First Amendment. Moreover, proper attribution alone cannot transform an infringing use into a fair one. In using copyrighted material in a news story or column, writers should make sure that no more of a copyrighted work than is necessary for a proper purpose is used, and that the work is not used in a way that impairs its value. In this regard, many people who post material to the internet (photographs, descriptions of events they have witnessed, or other creative works) intend for people to copy and pass them along. It is important to remember, however, that, absent express permission, copying or distributing those works will constitute infringement of copyright unless the fair use doctrine applies. (It also may constitute breach of contract, since the terms of use of many social media sites contain restrictions on use that may be made of material posted there.) And it is often particularly difficult to determine who is the actual owner of the copyright in material posted on the internet, precisely because it is so often reproduced (or re-posted) by others. For these reasons, special care is required when considering the use of material posted by others to the web or on social media platforms."}
{"source_url": "https://www.apstylebook.com/ap_stylebook/publication-privacy", "entry_header": "Publication: Privacy", "text_content": "– Invasion of privacy The roots of the right of privacy are often traced to an article titled \"The Right to Privacy\" that appeared in the Harvard Law Review in 1890, and was co-authored by Louis D. Brandeis, who later became a Supreme Court justice. The article asserted that the press of the day was \"overstepping in every direction the obvious bounds of propriety and decency,\" and urged courts to recognize a distinct cause of action that would protect the individual's \"right of privacy.\" As a Supreme Court justice, Brandeis later wrote: \"The makers of our Constitution recognized the significance of man's spiritual nature, of his feelings and of his intellect. They knew that only a part of the pain, pleasure and satisfactions of life are to be found in material things. They sought to protect Americans in their beliefs, their thoughts, their emotions and their sensations. They conferred, as against the government, the right to be let alone – the most comprehensive of rights and the right most valued by civilized men.\" ( Olmstead v. United States , Brandeis, J. dissenting.) Over the following decades, legal commentators have vigorously debated the scope and nature of a cause of action for privacy, and identified four distinct forms of the \"right of privacy:\" (1) misappropriation of someone's name or likeness for a commercial purpose; (2) public disclosure of private facts; (3) unreasonable intrusion upon seclusion, and (4) false light in the public eye. In recent times, these causes of action have taken on significance to the press as plaintiffs have attempted to avoid the heavy burdens of proof placed on the libel plaintiff by alleging an invasion of a form of the right of privacy, instead. The four distinct \"branches\" of the privacy tort each seek to protect a different aspect of an individual's privacy. The \"intrusion\" tort, which is discussed in more detail above, primarily seeks to protect against physical intrusions into a person's solitude or private affairs. The tort does not require publication of information for recovery, and it therefore is referred to as a \"newsgathering tort.\" The other three branches of privacy all require publication of some information in order for the plaintiff to have a claim. States vary widely both in terms of their acceptance of any of these right to privacy claims and in terms of the rules governing any such claims. Of the four forms of the \"privacy\" cause of action, New York only recognizes the claim for misappropriation of name or likeness for commercial purposes. Texas recognizes claims for intrusion upon seclusion, public disclosure of private facts and misappropriation of name or likeness for commercial purposes. The California state constitution expressly incorporates a right of privacy and California courts recognize all four forms of the right of privacy cause of action. Illinois courts also recognize all four privacy torts. The right of privacy creates liability for the publication of facts that are true, and thus raises particular concerns under the First Amendment. In a number of contexts the Supreme Court has struck down rulings imposing liability for reporting information that was both true and newsworthy, but it has consistently declined to hold that the First Amendment always bars such liability altogether. It can generally be said that when people become involved in a news event, voluntarily or involuntarily, they forfeit aspects of the right to privacy. A person somehow involved in a matter of legitimate public interest, even if not a bona fide spot news event, normally can be written about with safety. However, the same cannot be said about a story or picture that dredges up the sordid details of a person's past and has no current newsworthiness. Paul P. Ashley, then president of the Washington State Bar Association, summarized the privacy concern for reporters at a meeting of the Associated Press Managing Editors association: \"The essence of the wrong will be found in crudity, in ruthless exploitation of the woes or other personal affairs of private individuals who have done nothing noteworthy and have not by design or misadventure been involved in an event which tosses them into an arena subject to public gaze.\" – Publication of private facts When most people speak of an \"invasion of privacy,\" they have in mind the public disclosure of highly embarrassing private facts. In those states where such a claim is recognized, the elements of a cause of action generally include: (1) \"publicity\" given to private information, (2) that a reasonable person would find highly offensive, and (3) which is not of any legitimate public interest. In some states the lack of \"legitimate public interest\" or lack of \"newsworthiness\" is an element of the tort, meaning it is a plaintiff's burden to prove. In others, this element is an affirmative defense and the defendant must show how the information was indeed a matter of legitimate public concern. In all cases, newsworthiness is a complete defense to the tort. The First Amendment bars a claim for the true and accurate disclosure of a private fact so long as the information is newsworthy. The first element of the tort requires \"publicity\" given to private information. This requires some element of widespread disclosure to the general public, not simply a communication to a single person or small group of people. Conversely, facts that are already known to the general public cannot be the basis of a public disclosure claim, while facts known only to a small group can be. For example, a California court allowed a privacy claim to be based upon the publication of a photograph of a Little League team in a national magazine to illustrate a story about the team's coach who had sexually abused some of the athletes. Although the photograph had been given to all the members of the team, the identities of the minors shown in the photograph were not known to a broader national audience. The court said their identities could therefore be considered \"private\" in the context of the story about sex abuse. Some courts have similarly ruled that a person who is recognizable in a picture of a crowd in a public place is not entitled to the right of privacy, but if the camera singled him out for no news-connected reason, then his privacy might be invaded. The second element of the tort requires that the disclosure be \"highly offensive\" to a reasonable person. This factor goes to the embarrassing nature of the information itself. Reporting someone's age, for example, would not be highly offensive to a reasonable person, even if that information were not widely known. Reporting, over their objection, that someone was a victim of sexual abuse or suffered from an incurable disease might be. Finally, no claim will lie if the information is newsworthy, or of legitimate public concern. Courts generally will defer to reporters and editors to determine what is \"newsworthy,\" but the line is not always clear. Even in the context of a report on a plainly newsworthy topic, the disclosure of a highly embarrassing private fact may give rise to a claim for invasion of privacy if the facts are not logically related to the matter of public concern. For example, disclosure of the intimate sexual practices of a celebrity might support a claim for invasion of privacy if it were unrelated to any newsworthy report and amounted to prying into someone's life for its own sake. Some examples can help to demonstrate the nature of this branch of the privacy tort: In a case against a Chicago newspaper, an Illinois trial court held that a mother had stated a cause of action for invasion of privacy when she alleged that she told the newspaper reporter that she did not want to make any public statement about her son's death and where the reporter nevertheless remained in the private hospital room with the mother, recorded her grief-stricken last words to her son and subsequently published a picture of the son's dead body and the mother's \"last words\" to her son. The unsavory incidents of the past of a former prostitute, who had been tried for murder, acquitted, married and lived a respectable life, were featured in a motion picture. She sued for invasion of privacy by public disclosure of private facts. The court ruled that the use of her name in the picture and the statement in advertisements that the story was taken from true incidents in her life violated her right to pursue and obtain happiness. Another example of spot news interest: A child was injured in an auto accident in Alabama. A newspaper took a picture of the scene before the child was removed and ran it. That was spot news. Twenty months later a magazine used the picture to illustrate an article. The magazine was sued for public disclosure of private facts and lost the case, the court ruling that 20 months after the accident the child was no longer \"in the news.\" In another case, a newspaper photographer in search of a picture to illustrate a hot weather story took a picture of a woman sitting on her front porch. She wore a house dress, her hair in curlers, her feet in thong sandals. The picture was taken from a car parked across the street from the woman's home. She sued, charging invasion of privacy by intrusion upon seclusion and public disclosure of private facts. A court, denying the newspaper's motion for dismissal of the suit, said the scene photographed \"was not a particularly newsworthy incident,\" and the limits of decency were exceeded by \"surreptitious\" taking and publishing of pictures \"in an embarrassing pose.\" – False light invasion of privacy A claim for false light basically complains about publicity that places the plaintiff in a false light in the public eye. In those states that recognize this tort, the publicity must be of a kind that would be highly offensive to a reasonable person, and the defendant generally must have acted with the same level of fault that would be required if the plaintiff had filed a libel claim. One form in which a claim for false light occasionally arises occurs when an opinion or utterance is falsely attributed to the plaintiff. In another version of the claim, the plaintiff's picture is used to illustrate an article to which he has no reasonable connection, as where the picture of an honest taxi driver is used to illustrate an article about the cheating propensities of cab drivers. The Supreme Court of the United States ruled in 1967 that the constitutional guarantees of freedom of the press are applicable to claims for invasion-of-privacy by false light involving reports of newsworthy matters. Time Inc. v. Hill (1967). The ruling arose out of a reversal by the Supreme Court of a decision of a New York court that an article with photos in Life magazine reviewing a play, \"The Desperate Hours,\" violated the privacy of a couple who had been held hostage in a real-life incident. In illustrating the article, Life posed the actors in the house where the real family had been held captive. The family alleged violation of privacy by false light in the public eye, saying the article gave readers the false impression that the play was a true account of their experiences. Life said the article was \"basically truthful.\" The court said: \"We create grave risk of serious impairment of the indispensable service of a free press in a free society if we saddle the press with the impossible burden of verifying to a certainty the facts associated in a news article with a person's name, picture or portrait, particularly as related to non-defamatory matter.\" The court added, however, that these constitutional guarantees do not extend to \"knowing or reckless falsehood.\" A newspaper still may be liable for invasion of privacy if the facts of a story are changed deliberately or recklessly, or \"fictionalized.\" As with The New York Times and The Associated Press decisions in the field of libel, \"The Desperate Hours\" case does not confer a license for defamatory statements or for reckless disregard of the truth. An Illinois court allowed a \"false light\" claim to proceed where a news report allegedly broadcast the plaintiff's comments (which were covertly recorded) out of context. In a more famous case, a federal appeals court concluded that Gennifer Flowers could maintain a false light claim against James Carville for publishing facts suggesting she had lied about the nature of her relationship with President Bill Clinton. The court said the false light claim could compensate for emotional injury that would not be covered by a claim for defamation. – Misappropriation The final of the three \"publication\"-related forms of invasion of privacy recognized by the courts is misappropriation of the name or likeness of a living person for purposes of trade or advertising without that person's consent. In recent years, some states have included voice as well as name or likeness. This tort is intended to allow people to control the commercial use and exploitation of their own identities. The First Amendment provides for at least some exceptions to such a right – as where a candidate for public office includes his opponent's name and likeness in campaign advertisements. The misappropriation tort is not generally a concern to reporters because it applies to the commercial exploitation of a person's name and likeness. It does not bar editorial uses and provides no remedy when a person's name or image (questions of copyright aside) is used in a news report. This branch of privacy is of little concern outside of the advertising department of a news organization. – Publishing on the internet and social media Content published on the internet in blogs, chat rooms, discussion groups, social media sites and the like is generally subject to the same rules and standards for libel, privacy and other legal actions as any print publication. AP has adopted Social Media Guidelines that are intended to be followed by its employees. Those Guidelines require, among other things, that AP employees always \"identify themselves as being from the AP if they are using [social networking site] accounts for work in any way.\" And, \"if you or your department covers a subject . . . you have a special obligation to be even-handed in your tweets.\" The Guidelines also restrict AP employees from \"declaring their views on contentious public issues in any public forum and must not take part in organized action in support of causes or movements.\" The Guidelines say that it is acceptable to extend and accept Facebook friend requests from sources, politicians and newsmakers if necessary for reporting purposes, and to follow them on the social media platform X. “However, friending and `liking’ political candidates or causes may create a perception among people unfamiliar with the protocol of social networks that AP staffers are advocates. Therefore, staffers should try to make this kind of contact with figures on both sides of controversial issues. We should avoid interacting with newsmakers on their public pages – for instance, commenting on their posts.” AP employees are also cautioned to avoid retweeting in a way that makes it look like they are expressing a personal opinion on the issues of the day. \"A retweet with no comment of your own can easily be seen as sign of approval of what you're relaying.\" Because of the difficulty in verifying the authenticity of material posted on social media sites, it is important not simply to lift quotes, photos or video from social networking sites and attribute them to the domain or feed where the information was found. Before photos, videos or other online content is used, it is important to both verify its authenticity and ensure that any necessary rights for the reuse are obtained.

{"source_url": "https://www.apstylebook.com/ap_stylebook/publication-defenses-for-news-organizations", "entry_header": "Publication: Defenses for News Organizations", "text_content": "– Defenses commonly available to news organizations Where a news story is written in such a way that a plaintiff might be able to prove all five of the elements of a libel, the law nevertheless affords defenses to news organizations in certain circumstances. Among the most prominent are the \"fair comment privilege,\" the \"fair and accurate report privilege,\" and the \"neutral report privilege.\" They are referred to as privileges because, where properly invoked, a news organization is \"privileged\" to print what otherwise would be an actionable libel. 1. Fair comment The fair comment (sometimes, \"fair criticism\") privilege long predates the opinion doctrine and continues, in most states, to exist as an independent matter of state law. The right of fair comment has been summarized as follows: \"Everyone has a right to comment on matters of public interest and concern, provided they do so fairly and with an honest purpose. Such comments or criticism are not libelous, however severe in their terms, unless they are written maliciously. Thus it has been held that books, prints, pictures and statuary publicly exhibited, and the architecture of public buildings, and actors and exhibitors are all the legitimate subjects of newspapers' criticism, and such criticism fairly and honestly made is not libelous, however strong the terms of censure may be.\" ( Hoeppner v. Dunkirk Pr. Co. , 1930.) Some states, such as Texas, have recognized the fair comment privilege as a matter of statutory law. The Texas statute protects reasonable and fair comment or criticism of the official acts of public officials and of other matters of public concern when published for general information. Not all states recognize this privilege, and the specifics of its application vary among the states that do recognize it. But where an otherwise potentially libelous story is important to the public interest, careful consideration of whether this privilege might protect publication of the report may be appropriate. 2. Fair and accurate report Under this privilege, a fair and accurate report of a public proceeding (such as a city council hearing) or document (such as a pleading filed in court) generally cannot be the basis of a libel suit. Pursuant to the Texas fair report statute, for example, the privilege applies to \"a fair, true and impartial account\" of: (a) judicial proceedings; (b) an official proceeding to administer the law; (c) all executive and legislative proceedings; and (d) the proceedings of public meetings dealing with public purposes. New York and several other states likewise have created the privilege by statute along similar lines; in some states, the privilege is a product of judge-made law. In order to qualify for the privilege in the states that recognize it, the account must be both substantially accurate and fair. This does not mean the newspaper is required to publish a verbatim account of an official proceeding or the full text of a government document, but any abridgement or synopsis must be substantially accurate and fairly portrayed. Where it applies, the privilege relieves a news organization of responsibility for determining the underlying truth of the statements made by the participants in these contexts, precisely because the very fact that the comments were made in an official proceeding is newsworthy regardless of whether the statements are actually true. Some jurisdictions require that, to be privileged, the report expressly identify the official proceeding or document being reported upon. It bears emphasis that the privilege is limited to statements made in the contexts defined under state law, and it behooves reporters to learn the particulars of the privilege in the states in which they practice journalism. Statements made by government officials outside of official proceedings (e.g., statements by police or a prosecutor or an attorney on the courthouse steps), or in documents that have not been officially made part of the government record (e.g., a draft pleading provided by a lawyer that has not yet been filed with the court) may or may not qualify as privileged, depending on what state you are in and on the circumstances in which the statements are made. Some states only extend the privilege to such out of court statements if made by specified top officials. At least one New York trial court, however, has applied this fair report privilege to a news report based on information provided \"off the record\" by police sources. In New York and some other states, court rules provide that the papers filed in matrimonial actions are sealed and thus not open to inspection by the general public. It is not clear whether the fair report privilege will attach to publication of the contents of such papers, which by court rule, or order of the judge, are to be kept confidential. In one case where this very situation arose, the vice president of a company filed a libel suit in New York alleging that he was fired because a newspaper published his wife's charges of infidelity set forth in divorce proceedings. The newspaper responded that its report was a true and fair account of court proceedings. The New York Court of Appeals rejected that argument on grounds that the law makes details of marital cases secret because spatting spouses frequently make unfounded charges. The lesson of this case is that information gleaned from \"confidential\" court documents might not be covered under the fair report privilege. In such a case, the paper will be put to the test of proving that it made a reasonable effort to determine the truth of the allegations before publishing them. Similarly, not all U.S. states recognize a privilege for reporting the contents of foreign government proceedings or documents, at least in part because, according to some courts, it is not clear that the records of foreign governmental entities are as reliable as the records of American governmental units. There are other \"traps\" to be aware of when relying on this privilege. For example, statements made on the floor of convention sessions or from speakers' platforms organized by private organizations may not be privileged under the fair report privilege. Strictly speaking, conventions of private organizations are not \"public and official proceedings\" even though they may be forums for discussions of public questions. Similarly, while statements made by a governor in the course of executive proceedings have absolute privilege for the speaker (even if false or defamatory), the press' privilege to report all such statements is not always absolute. For example, after a civil rights march, George Wallace, then governor of Alabama, appeared on a television show and said some of the marchers were members of communist and communist-front organizations. He gave some names, which newspapers carried. Some libel suits resulted. 3. Neutral reportage Once viewed as a promising development in the law likely to spread across most states, the advancement of the neutral report privilege has not proceeded as once anticipated. Many states have declined to consider whether the privilege should exist, while others have rejected it outright (most recently, in Pennsylvania in 2004). Where recognized, the neutral report privilege protects a fair, true and impartial account of newsworthy statements, regardless of whether the reporter knows or believes those statements to be true, if the statements have been made by prominent and typically responsible persons or organizations. The rationale is that some statements are newsworthy, and should receive public attention just because of who has made them. Thus, for example, a news report concerning a statement by Michael Jordan concerning corruption in basketball, or by the NAACP regarding discrimination committed by a business, likely would be privileged as a neutral report, even if it should later turn out that Jordan or the NAACP were mistaken, since the mere leveling of charges by such prominent sources typically is of public concern. Significantly, the privilege, where it exists, does not apply when the author of an article goes beyond reporting the fact the statements were made and espouses or adopts the charges as the author's own. California is one of the few states to recognize the neutral report privilege. There, the privilege is available when the plaintiff is a public figure, the defamatory statement is made by one who is a party to a public controversy and the publication is accurate and neutral. One California court applying the privilege found that a newspaper's account of an accusation that a police officer had improperly obtained a false confession to a crime from a person later released as innocent was not actionable where the newspaper also printed the officer's denial of the charge. In some states, courts appear to have applied the principle without naming the privilege as such. In one 1997 case in Texas, for example, the court held that a story that accurately reported that parents of school children had accused a school teacher of physically threatening and verbally abusing their children was substantially true regardless of whether the parents' allegations themselves were accurate. More recently, in 2013, the Texas Supreme Court initially cast doubt on this line of cases, but then later clarified that it was not completely \"foreclosing\" the possibility that a news report, the sole purpose of which was to report allegations, could be tested for truth by examining whether it had accurately conveyed the allegations. Similarly, in Illinois, a federal appeals court in 2004 held that several stories that accurately reported that a charitable organization was the target of a federal investigation into terrorism funding were not actionable because the fact that the organization was under investigation was true, regardless of whether it was actually guilty of funding terrorism. New York state courts do not recognize a privilege for neutral reportage, though a federal court in New York has actually found a neutral reportage privilege grounded in the U.S. Constitution. As the federal court described the neutral report privilege in that case, \"when a responsible, prominent organization ... makes serious charges against a public figure, the First Amendment protects the accurate and disinterested reporting of those charges, regardless of the reporter's private views regarding their validity.\" ( Edwards v. National Audubon Society , 1977.) – Summary of practical points Although every AP story is expected to be accurate and fair, stories that involve negative reports about individuals or companies warrant particular attention. When evaluating such a story, it usually is prudent to ask these questions: 1. Are any statements in the story capable of defamatory meaning? In this regard pay close attention to the use of certain \"red flag\" words that may sound more negative (and thereby more defamatory) than if a different, but similar, word had been chosen. Words such as \"fraud,\" \"crony,\" \"linked,\" \"suspicious\" and \"contaminated\" may suggest or imply bad conduct or have criminal connotations (like:  \"connected\" to the Mafia or organized crime). Careful editing can ensure that the facts get reported without the use of \"buzz words\" that may trigger a libel claim. Remember that the fact that police are questioning someone about a crime does not necessarily justify the label suspect. Witnesses are obviously also questioned about a crime. 2. Are those statements ones of fact (capable of being proven true or false), or protected as opinion, or simply rhetorical hyperbole that no reasonable reader would understand as a statement of fact? 3. Could someone reading the report reasonably understand it to be about a specific person, whether or not the person is actually named?  Could readers understand it to be about more than one person – the person we intend, but also someone else? Remember to be careful of descriptive phrases that may give rise to cases of mistaken identity. A report that \"an elderly janitor for a local school\" was arrested could lead to suits from every elderly janitor in the school district. 4. Could you prove that the statements in question are true (and do so without violating promises to any confidential sources)? 5. If it turns out that you have the facts wrong, would a jury think you failed to do something that any reasonable journalist would have done to get it right? 6. Assuming there is some possibility that the first five questions could be answered in the plaintiff's favor, is there a privilege that nevertheless justifies proceeding to publish?  For example, is the report a fair and accurate report of an official government proceeding or document? If a privilege applies, remember that the privilege does not remove the need for careful reporting and the use of editorial judgment. In many cases, courts have held that it is up to the jury to decide whether a particular publication was a fair and accurate report or whether there was \"actual malice.\" Headlines, photos and captions must be as accurate and objective as news stories. Remember that each of these elements of a story can also give rise to claims of libel. – Document preservation and discovery A 1979 Supreme Court ruling, Herbert v. Lando , has had a significant impact on what materials a libel plaintiff can compel a news organization to disclose. The case ruled that retired Army Lt. Col. Anthony Herbert, a Vietnam veteran, had the right to inquire into the editing process of a CBS \"60 Minutes\" segment, produced by Barry Lando, which provoked his suit. Herbert had claimed the right to do this so that he could establish actual malice. The decision formalized and called attention to something that was at least implicit in New York Times v. Sullivan :  that a plaintiff had the right to try to prove the press was reckless or even knew that what it was printing was a lie. How else could this be done except through inquiry about a reporter's or editor's state of mind? Despite an admonition in Herbert v. Lando that lower courts should carefully monitor (and, if necessary, rein in) discovery in libel cases, reporters and publications involved in libel suits are often forced to expend significant time and resources on discovery concerning their newsgathering, writing and editing activities. Different reporters follow different practices about retaining their notes. There are potential litigation advantages and disadvantages from following a policy of either keeping notes for a number of years or disposing of notes as soon as they are no longer needed for reporting. The best practice is the one that best advances a reporter's journalistic goals. Whatever practice you follow, however, should be followed uniformly. A difficult issue is presented in litigation if a reporter generally keeps notes, but just doesn't happen to have the notes for a disputed story. Similarly, a reporter who never keeps notes, but happens to save them for a story that ends in litigation, can send a message that the story posed some unique concerns. Adopt a policy and follow it consistently. Of course, once a lawsuit arrives, no documents (including electronic files, notes, email messages and the like) should be destroyed or deleted, regardless of your usual practice. At that point any notes and drafts are potential evidence and their destruction, with knowledge of the lawsuit, may be illegal. – Motions practice If litigation arises, lawyers for a reporter will often seek to dispose of the claims without the necessity of a trial. A number of issues, such as whether a story is \"of and concerning\" the plaintiff or conveys the defamatory meaning alleged, can often be decided by a judge as a matter of law before any litigation discovery begins. Courts also can impose \"summary judgment\" dismissing a case at any point when the evidence developed by the parties demonstrates that the plaintiff's claims are legally defective. A judge may not enter summary judgment if it rests on any facts in dispute. Only the jury may decide disputed issues of fact. In a 1986 decision, Anderson v. Liberty Lobby , the Supreme Court held that summary judgment should be granted in libel actions against public officials and public figures unless the plaintiff can prove actual malice with \"convincing clarity\" or by \"clear and convincing evidence.\" This rule further facilitates the dismissal of unmeritorious claims without the expense and burden of proceeding to trial. Over the past twenty years, some states have gone one step further, enacting so-called anti-SLAPP statutes to bring to an end more expeditiously libel lawsuits involving issues of public concern that lack significant merit. The concept initially was to prevent baseless claims asserted by plaintiffs who did not hope to win the lawsuit, but who used litigation to intimidate and censor others.  Prime examples were unscrupulous real estate developers seeking to silence opponents of a zoning variance, and others engaged in \"strategic litigation against public participation.\" Anti-SLAPP statutes typically require a defamation plaintiff at the outset of a case to convince the court that reasonable grounds exist to believe a valid defamation claim exists, and they provide for an award of attorneys' fees to the defendant if the claim is found to be meritless. California has one of the broadest statutes, which applies its rules and procedures to any lawsuit challenging defendants for exercising their right of free speech \"in connection with a public issue.\" The California law can be invoked in certain situations to strike lawsuits challenging news reports on public issues, and in recent years some other jurisdictions have adopted similar broad press protections. – Trials and damages The huge jury verdicts that sometimes occur in libel cases have caused much concern among legal commentators and the press. A number of remedies have been proposed, including statutory caps on both compensatory and punitive damages. A 1996 non-press Supreme Court case, holding that some excessive damage verdicts might violate the Constitution, holds out some possible promise of relief. The Supreme Court addressed libel damages in Gertz v. Robert Welch, Inc. (1974), and held that in private figure cases, where \"actual malice\" has not been proven, any award of damages must be supported by competent evidence, represent compensation only for actual damages, must not be \"presumed,\" and must not be punitive. \"Actual damages,\" however, may include compensation for injury to reputation and standing in the community, personal humiliation, and mental anguish and suffering – all items to which a jury assigns a dollar value. In cases where a plaintiff has proved \"actual malice,\" he or she may also recover \"presumed\" and \"punitive\" damages. While the First Amendment imposes severe restrictions on libel claims, and court rules encourage the dismissal of meritless cases at the earliest point, litigation can be a long, expensive, and disruptive process. The key to avoiding the distraction of litigation is always to remember AP's credo:  Get it fast, but get it right."}

This section provides an overview of the law of defamation, privacy and copyright infringement, by examining what a plaintiff is required to prove against news organizations to succeed on such claims and the defenses that are available. Defamation In 1967, shortly after New York Times v. Sullivan was handed down, Associate Justice John Harlan remarked that \"the law of libel has changed substantially since the early days of the Republic.\" Unfortunately, the news stories that still generate the most claims of injury to reputation – the basis of libel – are still the run-of-the-mill. Perhaps 95 of 100 libel suits result from the routine publication of charges of crime, immorality, incompetence or inefficiency. A Harvard Nieman report makes the point: \"The gee-whiz, slam-bang stories usually aren't the ones that generate libel, but the innocent-appearing, potentially treacherous minor yarns from police courts and traffic cases, from routine meetings and from business reports.\" Most lawsuits based on relatively minor stories result from factual error or inexact language – for example, getting the plea wrong or inaccurately making it appear that all defendants in a case face identical charges. Libel even lurks in such innocent-appearing stories as birth notices and wedding announcements. Turner Catledge, former managing editor of The New York Times, noted in his autobiography, \"My Life and the Times,\" that people sometimes would \"call in the engagement of two people who hate each other, as a practical joke.\" The fact that some New York newspapers have had to defend suits for such announcements illustrates the care and concern required in every editorial department. In publishing, no matter what level of constitutional protection, there is just no substitute for accuracy. – What is libel? Libel is one side of the coin called \"defamation,\" slander being the flip side. At its most basic, defamation means injury to reputation. Libel is generally distinguished from slander, in that a libel is written, or otherwise printed, whereas a slander is spoken. While defamation published in a newspaper universally is regarded as libel, it is perhaps not so self-evident that, in many states, defamation broadcast by television or radio also is considered libel, rather than slander:  Because broadcast defamation is often recorded on tape and carried to a wide audience, it is viewed as more dangerous to reputation than a fleeting, unrecorded conversation, and so is classed with printed defamation. In any case, the term defamation generally includes both libel and slander. Words, pictures, cartoons, photo captions and headlines can all give rise to a claim for defamation. The various states define libel somewhat differently, but largely to the same effect. In Illinois, for example, libel is defined by the courts as \"the publication of anything injurious to the good name or reputation of another, or which tends to bring him into disrepute.\"  In New York, a libelous statement is one that tends to expose a person to hatred, contempt or aversion or to induce an evil or unsavory opinion of the person in the minds of a substantial number of people in the community. In Texas, libel is defined by statute as anything that \"tends to injure a living person's reputation and thereby expose the person to public hatred, contempt or ridicule, or financial injury or to impeach any person's honesty, integrity, virtue, or reputation or to publish the natural defects of anyone and thereby expose the person to public hatred, ridicule, or financial injury.\" – Liability for republication:  the 'conduit' fallacy A common misconception is that one who directly quotes a statement containing libelous allegations is immune from suit so long as the quoted statement was actually made, accurately transcribed and clearly attributed to the original speaker. This is not so. In fact, the common law principle is just the opposite – a republisher of a libel is generally considered just as responsible for the libel as the original speaker. That you were simply an accurate conduit for the statement of another is no defense to a libel claim. In many circumstances, therefore, a newspaper can be called to task for republishing a libelous statement made by someone quoted in a story. This rule can lead to harsh results and therefore exceptions exist. For example, reporting the fact that a plaintiff has filed a libel suit against a defendant could, in certain circumstances, lead to a claim against a newspaper for repeating the libel alleged in the complaint. In most states, a \"fair report privilege\" shields the publisher of an accurate and impartial report of the contents of legal papers filed in court to avoid this result. Many states also recognize that newspapers under the pressure of daily deadlines often rely on the research of other reputable news organizations in republishing news items originally appearing elsewhere. In such cases, reliance on a reputable newspaper or news agency often is recognized as a defense to a libel claim. Of course, this so-called \"wire service defense\" may not be available if the republisher had or should have had substantial reason to question the accuracy or good faith of the original story. The fair report privilege and the wire service defense are exceptions to the basic rule. When the press reports that X has leveled accusations against Y, the press may be held to account not only for the truth of the fact that the accusations were made, but also for the steps taken to verify the truth of the accusations. Therefore, when accusations are made against a person, it generally is prudent to investigate their truth as well as to obtain balancing comment with some relation to the original charges. Irrelevant countercharges can lead to problems with the person who made the first accusation. In short, always bear in mind that a newspaper can be held responsible in defamation for republishing the libelous statement made by another, even when the quote is correct. – The five things a successful libel plaintiff must prove Although the terminology may differ from state to state, a libel plaintiff suing a reporter or a news organization will have to prove five things in order to prevail on a claim for defamation: 1. A defamatory statement was made. 2. The defamatory statement is a matter of fact, not opinion. 3. The defamatory statement is false. 4. The defamatory statement is about (\"of and concerning\") the plaintiff. 5. The defamatory statement was published with the requisite degree of \"fault.\" By developing an understanding of the legal elements of a claim for libel, reporters and editors can fashion guideposts that will assist them in practicing their craft in a way that avoids wrongfully injuring the reputation of the subjects of their stories – and thereby reducing the legal risk to the publications for which they write. 1. A defamatory statement was made It may seem self-evident that a libel claim cannot exist unless a defamatory statement was made, but subjects of news stories (and their lawyers) often bring claims for libel without being able to demonstrate that what was written about them is capable of conveying a defamatory meaning. Put differently, not every negative news report is defamatory. Generally, statements accusing someone of being a criminal, an adulterer, insane or infected with a loathsome disease are considered automatically \"capable of defamatory meaning,\" as are statements that injure someone's professional reputation (such as that they are corrupt or incompetent). However, to determine whether any particular statement is susceptible of defamatory meaning, reference must be made, first, to the definition of libel adopted in the relevant state, and second, to the full context in which the challenged statement appeared when it was published. For example, a New York court found that a statement identifying an attorney as a \"flashy entertainment lawyer\" was not, without more, defamatory, although a statement that a lawyer was an \"ambulance chaser\" with an interest only in \"slam dunk\" cases would be. The reasoning is that the first statement would not necessarily damage a lawyer's reputation, while the latter would. Likewise, in New York, allegations of drunkenness, use of \"political clout\" to gain governmental benefit, membership in the \"Mafia,\" communist affiliation or that someone has cancer may or may not be defamatory, depending on the circumstances of the case. In Illinois, courts make determinations about defamatory meaning on a case-by-case basis, though in Illinois, most statements will not be considered defamatory unless they charge a person with commission of a crime, adultery/fornication, or incompetence or lack of integrity in their business or profession. Under this approach, the statement that plaintiff left his children home at night and lost his job because of drinking was held to be defamatory as an accusation of child neglect and inability to discharge the duties of his job due to alcoholism. Similarly, reporting that an alderman had disclosed confidential information was held to be defamatory as indicating that the official lacked the integrity to properly discharge the duties of his office. In Texas, a statement may be false, abusive and unpleasant without being defamatory. For example, a Texas court held that describing someone as resembling a \"hard boiled egg,\" referring to baldness and pudginess, was not defamatory. Likewise, describing a political candidate as a \"radical,\" \"backed and financed by big-shot labor bosses\" was not considered defamatory in Texas. On the other hand, an insinuation that a person is connected with gambling and prostitution was found to be defamatory. The assertion that a person who had made an allegation against another of child molestation had fabricated and since recanted the allegation was defamatory when no recantation had, in fact, been made. While each potentially defamatory statement must be assessed in its own context, particular caution is in order where the statement involves allegations of crime or similar wrongdoing, incompetence or unprofessionalism, or infidelity. 2. The defamatory statement is a matter of fact, not opinion To be actionable as libel, a defamatory statement must be provably false (or carry a provably false implication). Stated differently, only factual statements that are capable of being proven true or false can form the basis of a libel claim. \"Opinions\" that do not include or imply provably false facts cannot be the basis of a libel claim. Similarly, epithets, satire, parody and hyperbole that are incapable of being proven true or false are protected forms of expression. The Supreme Court, in Gertz v. Robert Welch Inc. (1974), recognized a constitutional dimension to the prohibition of libel claims based on opinion, stating that \"there is no such thing as a false idea.\"  In a later case, Milkovich v. Lorain Journal Co. (1990), the Supreme Court denied that there is a distinct constitutional \"opinion privilege,\" but held that any claim for libel must be based on a statement of fact that is provably false, thus shielding purely subjective opinions from liability. Under this approach, a statement is not protected \"opinion\" merely because it contains qualifying language such as \"I think\" or \"I believe,\" if what follows contains an assertion of fact that can be proven true or false (e.g., \"I believe he murdered his wife.\"). Some examples of actual cases can provide a better sense of the distinction between an actionable false fact and a protected opinion: In Virginia, \"pure expressions of opinion\" cannot be the basis of a claim for defamation. Under this standard, the statement \"I wouldn't trust him as far as I could throw him\" and the caption \"Director of Butt-Licking\" were held to be nonactionable opinion. The Virginia Supreme Court has found words charging that an architect lacked experience and charged excessive fees, or accusing a charitable foundation with failing to spend a \"reasonable portion\" of its income on program services, also to be protected opinions rather than to be verifiable facts. In New York, the test for distinguishing a fact from an opinion asks whether: (1) the statement has a precise core of meaning on which a consensus of understanding exists; (2) the statement is verifiable; (3) the textual context of the statement would cause an average reader to infer a factual meaning; and (4) the broader social context signals usage as either fact or opinion. The first two factors focus on the meaning of the words used, the latter two factors consider whether the content, tone and apparent purpose of the statement should signal to the reader that the statement reflects the author's opinion. Under these principles, calling a doctor a \"rotten apple,\" for example, is incapable of being proved true or false and is therefore protected as an expression of opinion. Similarly, a statement that someone lacked \"talent, ambition, initiative\" is a nonactionable expression of opinion, since there is no provable, common understanding of what quantum of talent or ambition constitutes a \"lack.\"  In one New York case, a letter to the editor published in a scientific journal submitted by the International Primate Protection League and which warned that a multinational corporation's plans for establishing facilities to conduct hepatitis research using chimpanzees could spread hepatitis to the rest of the chimpanzee population was, given its overall context, protected as opinion. Even when a fact is implicit in an opinion, the common law often protects the statement from liability. In many states, a statement of opinion based on true facts that are themselves accurately set forth is not actionable. Where the facts underlying the opinion are reported inaccurately, however, and would adversely affect the conclusion drawn by the average reader concerning the opinion expressed, the publication may give rise to a claim for libel. For example, the statement, \"I believe he murdered his wife because he was found with a bottle of the same kind of poison that killed her,\" likely would not be actionable even if the plaintiff could prove he did not murder his wife if it is true that he was found with a bottle of the same kind of poison that killed her. The true facts on which the (erroneous) opinion was based were disclosed to the readers. If there was no bottle of poison, however, the suggestion that he was a murderer would certainly be actionable. If an opinion suggests or appears to rely on an undisclosed fact, however, a libel claim may still be brought upon the unstated, implied facts if they are both false and defamatory. The statement that a sports commentator was a \"liar\" without reference to specific facts, under this approach, was considered to be protected opinion. Taken in the total context of an article, the statement that the plaintiff was a \"neo-Nazi\" was protected as opinion. Likewise, a statement calling a plaintiff a \"commie,\" suggesting that he does not understand the subject he teaches and that he is \"not traveling with a full set of luggage,\" was also protected as opinion. Statements accusing doctors of being \"cancer con-artists,\" of practicing \"medical quackery,\" and of promoting \"snake oil remedies,\" were also protected. A newspaper column and editorial characterizing a nudist pageant as \"pornography\" and as \"immoral\" were also protected. One federal appeals court has held that three questions should be considered to distinguish opinion from fact: (1) does the statement use figurative or hyperbolic language that would negate the impression that the statement is serious? (2) does the general tenor of the statement negate the impression that the statement is serious? (3) can the statement be proved true or false? Under this test, a commentator's statement that a product \"didn't work\" was not an opinion because, despite the humorous tenor of the comment, it did not use figurative or hyperbolic language, it could reasonably be understood as asserting an objective fact and the fact could be proven true or false. Likewise, a statement made in a newspaper interview that plaintiff was an \"extortionist\" was not protected as opinion. The common thread to these variations is that opinions offered in a context presenting the facts on which they are based will generally not be actionable. On the other hand, opinions that imply the existence of undisclosed, defamatory facts (i.e., if you knew what I know) are more likely to be actionable. In addition, a statement that is capable of being proven true or false, regardless of whether it is expressed as an opinion, an exaggeration or hyperbole, may be actionable. 3. The defamatory statement is false In almost all libel cases involving news organizations, the plaintiff has the burden of proving that the defamatory statement is false. (The states are divided on whether a purely private individual has to prove falsity when the defamatory statement does not involve a matter of public concern.)  Nonetheless, as a practical matter, a libel defendant's best defense is often to prove that the statement is true. While this may sound like six-of-one-half-dozen-of-the-other, there is considerable significance to placing on the plaintiff the legal burden of proving falsity:  Where a jury feels it cannot decide whether a statement is true or false because the evidence is mixed, it is required to rule against the plaintiff – ties go to the defendant. In almost all states, the question is not whether the challenged statement is literally and absolutely true, in every jot and tittle, but whether the statement as published is \"substantially true.\"  That is, a court will consider whether the gist or sting of the defamatory statement is accurate, or whether the published statement would produce a different effect in the mind of a reader than would the absolutely true version. For example, most courts will dismiss a libel claim brought by a person charged with second degree burglary, if a newspaper mistakenly reported that he had been charged with first-degree burglary:  The gist of the story (that the man is an accused burglar) is true, and most readers would not form a better opinion of the man had they been correctly informed that it was only second degree burglary with which he had been charged. But, where a newspaper mistakenly reports that the accused burglar has been charged with murder (or that a person thus far only accused of murder has been convicted of it), a court might well conclude that the \"sting\" of the statement is not substantially accurate, and that readers would think less of the person based on the false statement than they would have had the published report been accurate. 4. The defamatory statement is about the plaintiff Since the law of libel protects the reputation of an individual or a business entity, only the individual or entity whose reputation has been injured is entitled to complain. Thus, a libel plaintiff must prove that the defamatory statement was \"of and concerning\" the plaintiff. It often is obvious whether a statement is about a particular person (for example, because it gives his or her full name, place of residence and age). But even where no name is used, a libel claim may be brought if some readers would reasonably understand the statement to be about the plaintiff. For example, the statement referring to \"the woman who cooks lunch at the diner,\" when there is only one woman who cooks at that diner, will be considered \"of and concerning\" the female cook. In a recent Illinois case, a news report on the commencement of a murder trial referred to the defendant as \"suburban car dealer John Doe.\"  While \"John Doe\" was indeed on trial for murder, he was not a suburban car dealer. His brother, \"Joe Doe,\" was a suburban car dealer, but was not on trial for murder. The court concluded that reasonable readers could have understood the report to be about Joe (despite the fact that Joe's name was never mentioned, while John's was correctly used), and that Joe therefore would have the opportunity to show the statement was understood to be \"of and concerning\" him. A few words about \"group libel.\"  Where a statement impugns a group of persons, but no individual is specifically identified, no member of the group may sue for libel if the group is large. For example, the statement, in a large city, that \"all cab drivers cheat their customers out of money,\" does not allow any cab driver to sue for libel as a result, no matter how many fares the plaintiff cab driver may have lost because of the published statement. But, beware of publishing the same statement in a newspaper in a town with only a handful of cab drivers, where a court might well conclude the readers would reasonably think the statement was specifically referring to each of the town's four cab drivers, despite the absence of their names in the statement. Some courts have questioned whether the First Amendment permits claims for group libel under any circumstances, because the Supreme Court has said that the requirement that the statement be \"of and concerning\" the plaintiff is constitutionally required. In this regard, it is worth noting, most courts have held that a statement about a company is not, without more, \"of and concerning\" its officers, directors or employees (provided it is not a sole proprietorship).  By the same token, a statement about a CEO or other corporate official is not, without more, \"of and concerning\" the company itself. Finally, a word about the dead:  It is mostly correct that you cannot defame the dead. Again, because libel protects personal reputation, and one has no practical need for a good personal reputation in this world after one has departed it, most states do not permit a person's survivors to bring a claim for statements made after the person's death. 5. The defamatory statement was published with the requisite degree of fault For almost 200 years, libel in this country was a tort of strict liability. It did not matter whether the defendant was at fault or had acted in some improper way. The mere fact that a libel was printed was sufficient to establish liability New York Times v. Sullivan changed everything. In that case the Supreme Court first recognized the constitutional requirement that a public official must demonstrate not only that an error was made, but also a high degree of fault by the publisher in order to prevail on a libel claim. Somewhat confusingly referred to as \"actual malice,\" what such a plaintiff is required to prove is that the defendant published a \"calculated falsehood\" – that is, that the defendant knew the statement was false when published, or published the statement despite having a high degree of awareness that it probably was false (the latter is sometimes called \"reckless disregard\" for the truth). This additional burden was required under the First Amendment, the court said, in order to provide the \"breathing room\" for the exercise of free speech that is essential to public discussion by citizens on matters concerning their self-government. The court considered the Sullivan case \"against the background of a profound national commitment to the principle that debate on public issues should be uninhibited, robust and wide-open, and that it may well include vehement, caustic and sometimes unpleasantly sharp attacks on government and public officials.\" The ruling in Sullivan with respect to libel claims by public officials was extended three years later to libel claims by public figures, in The Associated Press v. Walker . The court reversed a $500,000 libel judgment won by former Maj. Gen. Edwin A. Walker in a Texas state court against the AP, after it had reported that Walker \"assumed command\" of rioters at the University of Mississippi and \"led a charge of students against federal marshals\" when James H. Meredith was admitted to the university in September 1962. Walker alleged those statements to be false. In ruling for the AP, the Supreme Court found: \"Under any reasoning, Gen. Walker was a public man in whose public conduct society and the press had a legitimate and substantial interest.\" It therefore held that Walker, too, was required to prove higher fault by the publisher even though he was not a public official. The rulings in the Sullivan and Walker cases were landmark decisions for freedom of the press and speech. They established safeguards not previously defined, but they did not provide news organizations with absolute immunity against libel suits by officials who are criticized. Rather, they stand for the principle that, to encourage public debate on matters of public concern, when a newspaper publishes information about a public official or public figure and publishes it without \"actual malice,\" it should be spared a damage suit even if some of the information turns out to be wrong. The Walker decision made an additional important distinction concerning the context in which an article is prepared. In a companion case consolidated before the Supreme Court, Wallace Butts, former athletic director of the University of Georgia, had obtained a libel verdict against Curtis Publishing Co. His suit was based on an article in the Saturday Evening Post accusing Butts of giving his football team's strategy secrets to an opposing coach prior to a game between the two schools. The Supreme Court found that Butts was a public figure, but said there was a substantial difference between the two cases. Unlike the AP report on the actions of Walker, \"the Butts story was in no sense 'hot news' and the editors of the magazine recognized the need for a thorough investigation of the serious charges. Elementary precautions were, nevertheless, ignored.\" Chief Justice Earl Warren, in a concurring opinion, referred to \"slipshod and sketchy investigatory techniques employed to check the veracity of the source\" in the Butts case. He said the evidence disclosed \"reckless disregard for the truth.\" The differing outcomes against The Associated Press and the Saturday Evening Post should be noted carefully. Although both involved public figures who were required to establish \"actual malice,\" the evidence sufficient to make this showing differed in the context of a \"hot news\" report from investigative reporting. By 1974, in Gertz v. Robert Welch, Inc. , the Supreme Court had extended the requirement that a libel plaintiff show some fault on the part of the defendant to include all defamation claims against news organizations, although not all types of plaintiffs must show the highest degree of fault. The level of \"fault\" that a plaintiff must prove will vary depending on who the plaintiff is. – Fault required for public officials and public figures If the plaintiff is a public official or public figure, the plaintiff must establish by clear and convincing evidence that the publication was made with \"actual malice,\" which, as noted, is an unfortunate choice of phrase by the Supreme Court for a concept that might better have been called \"constitutional fault,\" since the standard has little to do with whether a reporter harbored spite or ill will against the plaintiff. The first type of actual malice, \"knowing falsity,\" is easy to understand. \"Reckless disregard\" has required further elaboration by the courts, the best description of which perhaps is publication of a statement \"with a high degree of awareness of its probable falsity.\" Put differently, a reporter may act with reckless disregard for truth if he or she publishes despite holding serious doubts about the truth of the published statement. The test for actual malice thus looks to the subjective state of mind of the reporter/publisher at the time of publication. It inquires into whether the reporter or publisher believed the statement was false or whether he/she proceeded to publish despite recognizing that there was a good chance that the statement was false. Because most reporters and publishers are not in the business of publishing news reports unless they have good grounds to believe them to be true, generally speaking, it is difficult for a plaintiff to show that a newspaper published a story with actual malice. As one Illinois court phrased it, actual malice is shown only when a reporter's investigation \"has revealed either insufficient information to support the allegations in good faith or information which creates substantial doubt as to the truth of published allegations.\" Thus, as interpreted by most states, \"actual malice\" cannot be proven simply by showing that a reporter made mistakes (either by getting facts wrong or by failing to talk to one or more key sources), or that the reporter disliked the plaintiff, or that the newspaper frequently published items critical of the plaintiff. Rather, the test focuses on whether the reporter in fact disbelieved, or strongly doubted the truth of, the published statement. In some cases, plaintiffs may establish actual malice if they can show that a reporter willfully turned a blind eye to the truth and, if acting in good faith, would have known that the statement was false. – Fault required for private individuals Under the First Amendment, even private individuals must show some degree of fault before they can recover for a libel by a news organization in a report on a matter of public concern. States are free to set the standard of care that must be met in reporting on private individuals, so long as they require at least a showing of negligence. A number of states have decided to adopt the minimum standard and require a private libel plaintiff to show only that a reporter was negligent. That means the plaintiff must show that the reporter's conduct was less careful than one would expect of a reasonable journalist in similar circumstances. In Texas and California, for example, the question in a private figure libel case is whether the defendant should have known, through the exercise of reasonable care, that a statement was false. The courts have looked at a number of factors to evaluate whether \"negligence\" exists. The considerations include: Did the reporter follow the standards of investigation and reporting ordinarily adhered to by responsible publishers? In many libel cases plaintiffs will use \"expert\" witnesses to testify about what are the \"acceptable journalistic practices.\" Did the reporter follow his or her own normal procedures? Any time that you do something differently from what you usually do in reporting a story – particularly if the change involves exercising less care, rather than more care – you had better have a good explanation for why that was done. Did the reporter have any reason to doubt the accuracy of a source, or any advance warning that the story might not be right? Was it possible to find out the truth? This – like many of the factors the courts consider – is a matter of common sense. If you have received information that just does not ring true to you, and it is something that is easily checked, check it out before you run with the story! How much did the reporter do to check out the facts? Did the reporter take steps to confirm the information received, or simply run with the story without verifying the facts? Who are your sources of information? Are they reliable, and objective – or known \"flakes\" or people with a clear ax to grind? Are they anonymous sources? How many independent sources do you have (and how do they know the information they are giving you)? Some courts set different fault levels for private figures depending on whether the publication at issue involved a matter of \"public concern\" or of \"private concern.\" New York, for example, has held that if the plaintiff is a private individual involved in a matter of legitimate public concern, the plaintiff must establish by a preponderance of the evidence that the publication was made in a \"grossly irresponsible\" manner without due regard for the standards of information gathering and dissemination ordinarily followed by responsible parties involving similar matters. In cases involving matters of private concern, New York, too, applies a negligence standard, although New York courts typically defer to the press in determining what constitutes a matter of \"public concern\" (and thus the vast majority of New York private figure cases apply the \"gross irresponsibility\" standard). – Who is who? Needless to say, being able to determine whether the subject of a news story is a public official or figure or a private figure bears directly on the amount of legal risk posed by the story. While it is clear that not every government employee will be considered a public official for purposes of what they must prove in a libel case, the Supreme Court has yet to lay down definitive standards. Thus, the definition varies somewhat from state to state. In New York, public officials are those who are elected or appointed to office and who appear to have substantial responsibility for control over public and governmental affairs. Judges, police officers, state troopers and corrections officers have all been held to be public officials under this standard. Similarly, a public official is defined in California to be someone who has, or appears to the public to have, substantial responsibility for or control over the conduct of governmental affairs. In California, people found to be public officials have included a police officer, an assistant public defender and an assistant district attorney. Texas, in contrast, looks to the following criteria as relevant to determine whether a libel plaintiff is a public official: (1) the public interest in the public position held by the plaintiff; (2) the authority possessed by the plaintiff to act on behalf of a government entity; (3) the amount of governmental funds controlled by the plaintiff; (4) the number of employees the official supervises; (5) the amount of contact between the plaintiff and the public, and (6) the extent to which the plaintiff acts in a representative capacity for the governmental entity or has any direct dealings with the government. Under this standard, (1) a county sheriff; (2) a Child Protective Services specialist with authority to investigate charges of child abuse, remove children from their homes and place them in foster care; (3) an undercover narcotics agent employed by the state's law enforcement agency; (4) a ranking officer in charge of a narcotics squad of four men; (5) an individual who was a high school athletic director, head football coach and teacher; (6) an assistant regional administrator of a branch office of the Securities and Exchange Commission, and (7) a part-time city attorney have all been found to be public officials. But under the same Texas test, the following people were found not to be public officials: (1) a high school teacher; (2) a prominent member of two private organizations affiliated with a state university; (3) a former special counsel for a court of inquiry into county fund management; (4) a court reporter, and (5) an appointed justice of the peace (where the article appeared in a city where plaintiff was not justice of the peace and did not refer to plaintiff's official capacity). While, at least at higher ranks, it is relatively easy to identify public officials, both reporters and the courts have confronted substantial difficulty in the area of public figures, particularly in separating those who are merely socially or professionally prominent from those who, because of their influence over public matters, are properly considered public figures for libel purposes. For example, the 1976 case of Time v. Firestone stemmed from Time magazine's account of the divorce of Russell and Mary Alice Firestone. The magazine said she had been divorced on grounds of \"extreme cruelty and adultery.\" The court made no finding of adultery. She sued. The former Mrs. Firestone was a prominent social figure in Palm Beach, Florida, and held press conferences in the course of the divorce proceedings. Yet, the Supreme Court said she was not a public figure because \"she did not assume any role of special prominence in the affairs of society, other than perhaps Palm Beach society, and she did not thrust herself to the forefront of any particular public controversy in order to influence resolution of the issues involved in it.\" Similarly, Sen. William Proxmire of Wisconsin was sued for $8 million by Ronald Hutchinson, a research scientist who had received several public grants, including one for $50,000. Proxmire gave Hutchinson a \"Golden Fleece\" award, saying Hutchinson \"has made a fortune from his monkeys and in the process made a monkey of the American taxpayer.\" The Supreme Court held in 1979 that, despite the receipt of substantial public funds, Hutchinson was not a public figure because he held no particular sway over the resolution of matters of public concern. Note also the case of Ilya Wolston, who pleaded guilty in 1957 to criminal contempt for failing to appear before a grand jury investigating espionage. A book published in 1974 referred to these events. Wolston alleged that he had been libeled. In ruling on Wolston v. Reader's Digest , the Supreme Court said that he was not a public figure. The court said people convicted of crimes do not automatically become public figures. Wolston, the court said, was thrust into the public spotlight unwillingly, long after the events of public concern had ended. At bottom, although the Supreme Court has yet to definitively resolve the issue, the point appears to be that public figures are those who seek the limelight, who inject themselves into public debate, and who seek to influence public opinion. A person who has widespread influence over public opinion on many matters may be deemed a \"general purpose public figure\" and required to prove actual malice no matter the subject of a particular allegedly defamatory statement. Oprah Winfrey is an example of someone who likely would be deemed a general purpose public figure. A person who seeks to influence public opinion in only one area (such as, for example, by leading a campaign to enact animal rights legislation), however, may be deemed a \"limited purpose public figure\" and required to prove actual malice only with respect to allegedly defamatory statements about his or her animal rights activities. Limited purpose public figures have included: a prominent attorney; religious groups; a belly dancer; and a \"stripper for God,\" among others. Texas courts generally ask three questions in order to determine whether someone is a limited purpose public figure: (1) is the controversy truly a public controversy? (i.e., (a) are people talking about the controversy and (b) are people other than those immediately involved in the controversy likely to feel the impact of its resolution?); (2) does the plaintiff have more than a trivial or tangential role in the controversy?; (3) is the alleged defamation relevant to the plaintiff's participation in the controversy? Under this standard, an abortion protester on a public street in the vicinity of an abortion clinic was considered a limited purpose public figure, as was a zoologist who appeared on television shows and gave interviews on his controversial work. On the other hand, a public school teacher whose participation in public controversy did not exceed that which she was required to do by school district regulations (except that she responded to media inquiries), was not a public figure in California. Similarly, a corporation which conducted a closeout sale for a landmark department store was not a public figure simply because it was doing business with a party to a controversy. A note on corporations: In many states, the same standards that determine whether an individual is a public figure apply to corporations. Some states, however, conclude that corporations are always public figures, while others apply a narrower standard. For example, a British corporation that did not deal in consumer goods and had not received significant past publicity was a private figure for the purposes of a Texas libel claim. In addition, a few lower courts have embraced the concept of an \"involuntary public figure,\" in which an otherwise private person becomes a public figure by virtue of his or her having become drawn into a significant public controversy. While this area of the law is freighted with subtleties to which lawyers and judges devote considerable energy, the practical bottom line is that, while public officials and public figures always bear a high burden of proof in making out a libel claim, where a news story concerns a private individual, whether involved in a matter of public concern or not, his or her burden is likely to be lower, perhaps much lower, if the story is wrong. Accordingly, there are more legal risks to publishing reports about private individuals (especially where the matter is not of legitimate public concern)."}
{"source_url": "https://www.apstylebook.com/ap_stylebook/issues-concerning-sources", "entry_header": "Issues concerning sources", "text_content": "For better or worse, some sources who possess important information of great public significance will speak to a journalist only if they are promised confidentiality. This has been true from the earliest history of an independent press in America. John Peter Zenger, whose New York trial in 1735 is best remembered for establishing the principle that truth is a defense to a claim for libel, was also the first American newspaperman to establish the tradition that journalists will protect their sources to the point of imprisonment. Zenger refused to divulge to British authorities the identities of those who made the statements that authorities considered libelous. The use of confidential sources remains an important means for reporters to uncover the news. Such sources make available to the public more than the sanitized \"spin\" of government and corporate news releases. Yale professor Alexander Bickel noted: \"Indispensable information comes in confidence from officeholders fearful of superiors, from businessmen fearful of competitors, from informers operating at the edge of the law who are in danger of reprisal from criminal associates, from people afraid of the law and government – sometimes rightly afraid, but as often from an excess of caution – and from men in all fields anxious not to incur censure for unorthodox or unpopular views.\" (\"The Morality of Consent,\" 1975.) In one study of some 10,000 news reports conducted in 2005, 13% of the front-page newspaper articles reviewed were based, at least in part, on anonymous sources. Promising confidentiality to a source always raises a number of issues, legal and journalistic. If a reporter refuses to identify a source, there is always the potential that a publisher may be hauled into court or a reporter thrown into jail. If a publisher is sued for libel, having a story based on sources that were promised confidentiality creates an entirely separate set of concerns: it is hard to prove the \"truth\" of a statement if the source of the information cannot be revealed. In one case, a Massachusetts court entered a default judgment against the Boston Globe for refusing to reveal its confidential source for a story that became the subject of a libel claim. A jury subsequently awarded the plaintiff $2.1 million – a hefty price to pay to uphold a promise to a source. – A promise to a source creates an enforceable agreement A reporter who reveals the name or identity of someone who was promised confidentiality can be held liable for breach of the agreement. The Supreme Court decided just this issue in Cohen v. Cowles (1991), a case involving \"dirt\" on one political candidate that was provided to a newspaper reporter on the eve of the election by a political consultant for the candidate's opponent. The reporter promised the consultant confidentiality. His editors, however, considered the identification of the source necessary for the public to weigh the significance of the new disclosures, and overruled the reporter. As a result, the no-longer confidential source lost his job, and sued. A jury verdict of $200,000 in favor of the spurned source was upheld by the Supreme Court, which found the First Amendment no defense to a claim for the damages caused by breaking a promise freely made. The same result was reached by a New York court in a case involving a promise to mask someone's identity in a photograph. A journalist promised a man receiving treatment in an AIDS clinic that he would not be \"identifiable\" if he allowed his photograph to be taken. The journalist used a rear-angle setup and retouching techniques to obscure his identity, but the man's friends still recognized him when the photograph was published. The New York court held that the burden of carrying out the promise to disguise rested with the journalist who made the promise, and upheld the jury's award of damages to the patient. Reporters can unwittingly create problems for themselves in making agreements with sources to protect confidentiality, or in failing to clarify with the source the meaning of an agreement. A few common-sense steps can minimize the risk that problems with sources will develop: Before making any promise, consider whether it is worth doing: How important is the information that the source is going to provide? Can the information be obtained or confirmed from any \"on-the-record\" source? If a promise of some protection is to be made, express it in terms of the steps that will be taken to protect the source rather than the result to be achieved. For example, promise a source to not use the name, or agree on how the source will be identified in the story (a \"high-ranking military officer,\" or a \"knowledgeable Defense Department official\"), rather than promising \"no one will know you gave me this information.\" If a photograph or videotape is involved, the key is still to promise a specific action (\"I will photograph you only from behind\") rather than promising a result (\"no one will recognize you\"). Make sure the source has the same understanding of the scope of the promise made as you do. Avoid using ambiguous terms as a shorthand for an agreement, such as \"this will be off the record,\" or this is \"confidential.\" Instead, be specific about the terms of the agreement and how far the promise extends. Must confidentiality be maintained if litigation results? If a court order requires disclosure? Or, will the source allow disclosure in certain situations? Follow through with any agreement, making sure to inform editors and others who need to know to carry out the promise. The broader the promise, the more the effort needed to make sure that it is upheld. The bottom line is this: promises of confidentiality or anonymity should be made cautiously, and only after a determination that the risk of such promises is outweighed by the need for the information. When a promise is made, make sure it is as precise as possible, and then make sure it is carried out. – Reporter's privilege Given the importance of confidential sources, reporters have long asserted a right to protect the identity of those to whom confidentiality was promised. All states except Wyoming have provided some level of protection for reporters who are called to testify about their sources. Thirty-nine states and the District of Columbia have enacted \"shield laws\" that provide legal protection against the disclosure of sources; Hawaii's statute recently expired under a sunset provision and it has not as of this writing been re-enacted; nine additional states have recognized some form of a \"reporter's privilege\" through judicial decisions. About half of the state shield laws provide reporters with an absolute privilege not to disclose confidential sources, while the remainder establish a high standard that must be met before a reporter's promise of confidentiality can be pierced. The existence and scope of the reporter's privilege is more confused in federal courts. Although significant efforts have been made in recent years, there is no federal shield law, and the Supreme Court has addressed the \"reporter's privilege\" only once – in a ruling that is far from clear. In Branzburg v. Hayes (1972), the Supreme Court considered claims of privilege asserted by three journalists who had been subpoenaed to reveal confidential information and sources before grand juries investigating possible criminal activity. The reporters had written stories describing the synthesizing of hashish, conversations with admitted drug users, and eyewitness accounts of events at Black Panther headquarters at a time of civil unrest in the surrounding neighborhood. In each instance, the journalist claimed a privilege under the First Amendment not to answer questions concerning confidential information and sources. A closely divided Supreme Court held in a 5-4 ruling that it did not violate the First Amendment to require these journalists to testify in the grand jury investigations, conducted in good faith, concerning the identities of persons allegedly engaged in criminal conduct. The court, however, did not reject altogether the notion of a First Amendment privilege. To the contrary, the majority opinion expressed the view that its narrow focus should not apply to \"the vast bulk of confidential relationships between reporters and their sources,\" and emphasized that even grand juries \"must operate within the limits of the First Amendment as well as the Fifth.\" Justice Lewis Powell cast the decisive fifth vote and wrote separately to underscore further the \"limited nature\" of the court's holding. He explained that reporters would still have access to the courts, and could move to quash a subpoena if confidential source information were being sought \"without a legitimate need of law enforcement.\" Court decisions over the ensuing decades have embraced a qualified reporter's privilege that accommodates the interests of the press and those who seek to obtain information through judicial process. The United States Courts of Appeals in 10 of the 12 federal circuits have specifically applied the First Amendment reporter's privilege in civil lawsuits. Courts, however, have read Branzburg more restrictively in the criminal context, sometimes declining to recognize a privilege at all, or allowing only a very limited balancing of interests. Three different federal appellate courts affirmed contempt citations requiring reporters to be jailed for refusing to reveal confidential sources sought in criminal investigations. In 2001, freelance writer Vanessa Leggett served nearly six months in a Texas prison for declining to reveal sources of information related to a notorious murder, almost four times longer than any prison term previously imposed on any reporter by any federal court. In 2004, James Taricani, a reporter for WJAR-TV in Rhode Island, completed a four-month sentence of home confinement for declining to reveal who leaked a videotape capturing alleged corruption by public officials in Providence. And, in 2005 The New York Times reporter Judith Miller was jailed in Virginia for several months for refusing to disclose her confidential source for a story she never wrote about CIA operative Valerie Plame. Most recently, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit rejected any First Amendment-based or common law reporter's privilege in a criminal proceeding in which the subpoenaed journalist, James Risen, was an \"eyewitness\" to a crime. In this case, a confidential source allegedly leaked classified information to Risen and Risen was then subpoenaed to testify whether the criminal defendant was, in fact, his source. ( U.S. v. Sterling ). The U.S. Court of Appeals in Richmond held that Risen had no privilege whatsoever to refuse to testify in this context, and the Supreme Court refused to review the holding. When the case against the source went to trial, however, Attorney General Eric Holder decided that Risen's testimony was not needed, and Risen was not forced to testify. The CIA officer accused of being the source was convicted without compelling the reporter to testify or go to jail. The aggressive court actions in criminal investigations have encouraged private litigants and federal courts adjudicating their civil cases also to demand confidential information from reporters. In one civil suit, five reporters (including two Pulitzer Prize winners) were held in contempt and subjected to fines of $500 per day each for declining to reveal their confidential sources of information about Dr. Wen Ho Lee, who claimed information about him was provided to reporters by government agents in violation of the Privacy Act. Because the scope of a reporter's privilege in the federal courts is unsettled, reporters have been aided in federal investigations by Department of Justice guidelines that severely limit the circumstances under which U.S. attorneys may attempt to subpoena or search members of the news media. These guidelines were first enacted in 1970, but were most recently revised in 2014 and 2015 after public uproar over revelations that the department had secretly subpoenaed the telephone records of the AP in connection with a national security leak investigation and had obtained a search warrant for the email of a Fox News reporter in another leak investigation. The guidelines currently in effect apply to subpoenas and similar compulsory process, court orders issued pursuant to 18 U.S.C. § 2703(d) or 18 U.S.C. § 3123, and warrants intended either \"to obtain information from members of the news media\" or to procure \"communications records\" or \"business records\" of members of the news media that are held by third parties. A notable limitation is that the guidelines protect only information related to \"newsgathering activity,\" a term which is left undefined. Where the guidelines apply, they generally require that all members of the department obtain the approval of the attorney general or relevant assistant attorney general before issuing a subpoena or requesting a court order seeking documents or information covered by the guidelines. They make clear that steps to seek information from a member of the news media are considered \"extraordinary measures, not standard investigatory practices.\" In deciding whether to authorize such a subpoena or seek a court order, the attorney general considers (a) in criminal matters, whether there are reasonable grounds to believe that a crime has occurred, and whether the information sought is essential to a successful investigation or prosecution; (b) in civil matters, whether there are reasonable grounds to believe that the information is essential to the successful completion of the investigation or litigation in a case of substantial importance; and (c) in all matters, whether the government has made all reasonable attempts to obtain the information from alternative, non-media sources. The government is also generally required to give reasonable notice to the journalists implicated before seeking a subpoena or court order, and to negotiate with them. The attorney general will generally limit any authorization to seeking evidence needed to verify the accuracy of published information and the circumstances surrounding such information, and requires all requests for information from the news media to be \"narrowly drawn\" to avoid imposing an undue burden. These regulations provide the same types of protection contained in some state shield laws, and the Department of Justice has demonstrated a serious desire to enforce these regulations strictly. Any time a subpoena is received by a reporter from a U.S. attorney, the first question to ask the attorney is: Did you comply with the media guidelines at 28 C.F.R. 50.10 before issuing this subpoena? Not infrequently, just asking the question results in the subpoena being withdrawn. – Liability for newsgathering conduct A reporter for Mother Jones won a national award in 1984 for posing as a job applicant at a chemical factory and covertly taking photographs documenting illegal pesticides being manufactured for the export market. That conduct today would more likely win a lawsuit. In holding that a reporter's promise of confidentiality is legally binding, the Supreme Court in Cohen v. Cowles (1991) announced that \"generally applicable\" laws having only \"incidental effects\" on the ability of the press to gather the news do not offend the First Amendment. Ever since, a flow of lawsuits have been filed against reporters asserting claims for such \"generally applicable\" torts as intrusion, trespass, and fraud, and more recently, asserting claims for accessing password-protected computers or voicemail. From the muzzling effect of the tobacco industry's threat of \"tortious interference\" liability against CBS for an expose based on a confidential source who was party to a standard confidentiality agreement as an employee of a tobacco company, through Food Lion's claim of trespass, fraud and breach of duty leveled against ABC and a spate of other hidden camera lawsuits, reporters since Cohen v. Cowles have faced an increased number of claims alleging misconduct in the gathering of the news. This section highlights briefly some of the legal theories that can create problems for the unwary reporter. – Intrusion upon seclusion A claim for intrusion exists in most states if someone intentionally commits a \"highly offensive\" intrusion upon another's solitude or seclusion, invading either a physical space or the private affairs of the plaintiff, such as reviewing private financial statements or personal email without permission. Intrusion claims against the press most commonly arise in three contexts: (1) surreptitious surveillance; (2) trespass of private property, and (3) instances where consent to enter a private setting for one purpose has been exceeded (as where a reporter gains access to information under false pretenses). Intrusion is a branch of the law of privacy. Where the potentially offending conduct occurs is therefore important. For example, in the United States a person generally has no legitimate basis to complain if a picture is taken in a public place, but if the picture is taken in or around the person's home, a claim for intrusion may exist if the person had a \"reasonable expectation\" of privacy where the photograph was taken. In one noted lawsuit a few years back, the family of an officer of a large health care corporation successfully obtained an injunction against the elaborate efforts of a news organization that was seeking information about the family. The organization's camera crew followed the children to school, and sat in a boat outside the family's Florida home with a camera equipped with a high-powered telescopic lens. In issuing an injunction, the court concluded that \"a persistent course of hounding, harassment and unreasonable surveillance, even if conducted in a public or semi-public place,\" could support a claim for intrusion upon seclusion. A claim for intrusion generally requires (1) an intentional intrusion, (2) that impinges upon the solitude or seclusion of another, or his private affairs, and (3) that would be highly offensive to a reasonable person. The term \"highly offensive\" is ill-defined, but can include harassing behavior, surreptitious surveillance, or the use of high-power lenses and listening devices to invade typically private places. The tort of intrusion is based on wrongful conduct rather than on the publication of any information, so a claim may exist even when the news story being pursued is never published. For this reason, in many states it is no defense to an intrusion claim to assert the newsworthiness of the information that was being sought. The issue is whether a reasonable person would view the conduct as highly offensive under all the circumstances. Some examples where courts have upheld claims for intrusion illustrate the nature of the tort: –Two journalists in California, without discussing who they were, gained access to the home of a disabled veteran who purported to provide healing aids in the form of clay, minerals and herbs. While there, they surreptitiously photographed and tape-recorded the veteran, for use in a magazine report. The court allowed a claim for intrusion even though the reporters were invited into the home by the veteran. While a person takes the risk that someone allowed into their home is not what he seems, and even though a visitor is free to repeat anything he sees or hears, the court held that the homeowner's risk does not extend to the risk that secret photographs and recordings will be transmitted to the world at large. –The unauthorized recording of an unplanned interview conducted when the plaintiff answered his own front door has similarly been held to constitute an actionable \"intrusion,\" while secretly recording an interview of a person who stepped from their home onto a public sidewalk was held not to be an intrusion. –Televising an image of a person's home is not an intrusion if the broadcast shows no more than what can be seen from the street, and secretly recording a conversation in a place of business was held not to be an intrusion if the reporter was invited into the office and the state wiretap law permitted the secret recording. – Trespass A person commits a trespass by entering property that is in the possession of another, without authorization or consent. To avoid a claim, permission must be obtained by an owner, a tenant or someone acting on their behalf. Like intrusion, a trespass claim arises from conduct in gathering news, not from the content of any report that may subsequently be published. Permission to be on private property can be implied by custom or by the nature of the premises. For example, someone has implied permission to enter a store or restaurant during business hours, even though it may be located on private property. There is similarly an implied right to approach someone's house on a driveway or sidewalk to see if they are home. Permission, whether express or implied, can also be revoked. If a posted sign says \"Do Not Enter,\" or if the owner came to the door and said to leave, remaining on the property likely would be a trespass. Trespass is also a strict liability tort. Entering on someone's property without permission, even by accident or mistake, will constitute a trespass. On the other hand, trespass protects only against a physical invasion of property; it does not limit the collection or use of information gathered while on the property. The law of trespass does not restrict a reporter on a public sidewalk from using what can be seen or heard on the adjacent private property. The impact of trespass on newsgathering is also tempered by the nature of the damages that may be recovered through a claim for trespass. The trespass tort is intended to protect property, not privacy or reputation. A trespasser therefore can be held responsible only for physical harm done while on the land and other injury that is a \"natural consequence\" of the trespass. Courts generally will not recognize injury to reputation or emotional distress caused by the later publication of a photograph obtained during a trespass to be a \"natural consequence\" of the trespass itself. A vivid example of a trespass claim involved a television camera crew that was preparing a report on credit card fraud. The United States Secret Service obtained a warrant to search an apartment for evidence of credit card fraud, and a news magazine camera crew followed the Secret Service into the apartment. Part of the search was taped, including a sequence of a mother and child cowering on the couch asking not be photographed. In refusing to dismiss a lawsuit asserting claims for trespass and a constitutional tort (for improperly accompanying federal agents in executing a search warrant), an outraged court said the reporters \"had no greater right than that of a common thief to be in the apartment.\" Like intrusion, the trespass was complete once the invasion of private property occurred. The trespass claim could be asserted even though the news report being pursued was never broadcast. In situations rife with the potential for trespass, common sense can once again minimize the risk of litigation: Whenever possible, ask the property owner or those who appear to be in charge for permission to enter, or seek their approval to remain. In situations where police or fire officials have taken control of a crime or disaster scene, they may stand in for the owner and grant or deny access. Their presence does not defeat the owner's rights, however, and the owner can still require a reporter to leave private property. Always identify yourself – verbally, by displaying a press credential, and through insignias on clothing and cameras – so that those present know you are a reporter and will not assume you are part of any police or emergency response team. If not asked to leave, the fact that your status as a reporter was disclosed may be sufficient to establish an implied consent to remain. If asked to leave, retire to the sidewalk, street, or other position on public property. Consent obtained through fraud or misrepresentation will not be considered valid consent and will not defeat a claim for trespass. Consent obtained from minors or others who are not legally capable of giving consent (mentally incapacitated people, for example) will not defeat a claim for trespass. – Electronic eavesdropping Both state and federal law regulate the electronic recording of conversations, including telephone conversations. Under the federal law, a conversation may not be recorded without the consent of at least one of the participants. That means reporters are not prohibited by federal law from recording any conversation in which they participate, whether or not they disclose that the conversation is being recorded. But, leaving a hidden tape recorder in a room to record a conversation between others, secretly listening in on an extension phone and recording the conversation, or recording a telephone call picked up on a scanner or listening device, is a violation of federal law if done without permission of one of the parties. The law in most states is similar to the federal law, allowing a conversation to be recorded so long as one party to the conversation consents. The laws in a minority of states are more strict, and prohibit recording any conversation unless permission is given by all the parties to the conversation. This requirement of consent extends only to conversations where there is some expectation of privacy, and does not prohibit tape-recording at speeches, press conferences and similar public events. – Misrepresentation and similar forms of wrongdoing Laws of general applicability govern the actions of reporters, yet conduct that might sometimes be deemed \"deceit,\" \"misrepresentation\" or \"fraud\" can be useful in ferreting out the news. Reporters are often less than candid in dealing with those from whom they want information. Recognizing this reality, some courts have held that claims such as fraud and misrepresentation cannot be pursued against journalists unless the wrong is \"particularly egregious,\" or part of a broader pattern of wrongdoing. For example, courts have rejected claims for fraud based on a false message left on a telephone answering machine to induce the disclosure of information, and for falsely promising that no \"ambush\" techniques would be used if an interview were granted. Other courts have been less willing to weigh the public interest in a news report against the allegedly wrongful conduct. In one instance, a judge allowed claims for fraud and breach of contract to proceed against Business Week after a reporter gained access to records of a credit reporting agency by misrepresenting that a subscription to the credit service was being sought in order to conduct background checks on potential Business Week employees. In reality, information was sought for an exposé on the credit-reporting industry, and the reporter promptly obtained the credit history of then-Vice President Dan Quayle without his consent. The court held that such \"wanton misconduct\" can result in liability, and allowed a recovery of the costs incurred by the credit agency as a result of the misrepresentation. Remember, the basic rule is that reporters must obey rules and regulations when they are gathering the news. While there are some exceptions, the First Amendment will not generally provide a defense to a reporter who violates the law while gathering the news. – Special Considerations When Dealing with National Security Issues The Espionage Act (of 1917) makes it a federal crime to publish classified information that either (a) reveals the communications intelligence activities of the United States or any foreign country, or (b) discloses classified information obtained from a foreign government or military force through the \"processes of communications intelligence.\"  The Espionage Act also broadly makes it a crime for any unauthorized person either to communicate to another, or to retain possession of \"information relating to national defense\" if there is \"reason to believe\" the information could harm the U.S. or help a foreign nation or military force. In the decades since the statute was enacted, there has never been a prosecution of a news organization for violating the Espionage Act, but there has been saber-rattling from time to time. In December 2010, for example, Sen. Joseph Lieberman publicly called upon the Justice Department to investigate whether The New York Times had violated the Espionage Act by publishing confidential U.S. diplomatic cables it had obtained from WikiLeaks. And, in June 2013, Rep. Peter King, chairman of the House Subcommittee on Counterterrorism, repeatedly called for the prosecution of journalists who \"severely compromise national security,\" singling out Glenn Greenwald, then a journalist for The Guardian, for publishing news reports based on the documents leaked by Edward Snowden. The application of the Espionage Act to a news organization would raise significant First Amendment issues and might well run afoul of the doctrine barring application of criminal sanctions against the press for publishing truthful information on matters of public concern. It would also raise a number of significant issues, including the propriety of the classification of the information at issue; the vagueness and breadth of the statute when applied to the press; and the lack of the meaning of \"harm\" to our national security and the burden of proving it. Given the continuing uncertainty surrounding the Espionage Act, special care should be taken before accepting or communicating information known to be classified, and legal guidance sought where appropriate. Because the act is not literally limited to \"classified\" information, special care should be taken with any nonpublic information concerning official intelligence activities or communications with foreign governments. In order to avoid exposure for possible conspiracy and \"aiding and abetting\" liability or both, it is also important to maintain a traditional source-news organization relationship with those individuals who may provide you with national security information, although this is no guarantee of immunity from prosecution. In 2011, as part of a national security leak investigation, the Justice Department obtained a search warrant for the email of a Fox News reporter who allegedly obtained classified information from a State Department source. In applying for the warrant, the department told the court that the reporter had asked the source to disclose newsworthy information he knew to be classified, and asserted that in doing so the reporter was aiding and abetting a violation of the Espionage Act. When the search warrant application was made public months later, a firestorm erupted over the assertion that a reporter had committed a crime simply by asking for information. Attorney General Holder subsequently acknowledged that the department had never intended to prosecute the reporter and had over-stepped its bounds in making the allegation of criminality. Holder vowed that no reporter would go to jail for \"engaging in journalism\" so long as he was attorney general. Holder then revised the departmental guidelines to prevent a search warrant from being sought for a reporter's records unless the reporter is indeed the target of an active criminal investigation. Holder's successor, Loretta Lynch, has indicated that she will stand by his policy of not jailing journalists for doing their jobs. The Trump administration’s position in this regard is uncertain, though Attorney General Jeff Sessions has declined to “make a blanket commitment” endorsing the prior approach."}
{"source_url": "https://www.apstylebook.com/ap_stylebook/legal-principles-of-newsgathering", "entry_header": "LEGAL PRINCIPLES OF NEWSGATHERING", "text_content": "Several legal rules have special importance to the way the news is gathered. This chapter takes up three of them: the affirmative rights that can be invoked to compel access to government proceedings and the release of government documents; the legal protections that often allow reporters to obtain information through a promise of confidentiality; and the \"laws of general applicability,\" such as intrusion, trespass, and misrepresentation, that reporters must usually follow, even when they inhibit the ability to seek out the news. Access to government information Public access to information about the actions of government is essential in a democracy. James Madison made just this point in 1832: \"A Popular Government, without popular information, or the means of acquiring it, is but a Prologue to a Farce or a Tragedy; or perhaps both. Knowledge will forever govern ignorance: And a people who mean to be their own Governors, must arm themselves with the power which knowledge gives.\" The press and public have affirmative rights, both constitutional and statutory, to compel access to the type of government information that is essential to the functioning of our democracy. A right of access extends to official proceedings , including court trials, hearings, and the meetings of some legislative bodies and administrative agencies. Access rights also extend to the inspection of documents held by the government, with only specific exceptions. Given the independence of the three branches of government, the scope of access to judicial proceedings and court records is largely governed by constitutional and common law principles articulated by judges, while access to information in the executive and legislative branches is largely governed by statutes and administrative regulations. These access rights are not absolute; they can be abridged in a number of situations. Nonetheless, clear legal standards define the scope of these rights and the procedures available to reporters to enforce them. – Recognition of a First Amendment right of access The articulation by the Supreme Court in 1980 of a constitutional right to certain information about the exercise of government power, and the delineation of the proper scope and application of that right over the ensuing years, would provide a fascinating case study of the meaning of a \"living constitution.\" In Richmond Newspapers v. Virginia , the Supreme Court ruled for the first time that the First Amendment encompasses an affirmative, enforceable right of public access to criminal trials. As the court later explained the rationale for this new constitutional right, \"a major purpose\" of the First Amendment's protection of free speech, a free press and the right to petition the government is the public's need to know what the government is up to, if democracy is to function. Just as other provisions of the Bill of Rights have been read to imply the right to travel, a right to privacy, and the right to be presumed innocent, the court concluded that the First Amendment implies a right of the public to certain information concerning the direct exercise of government power. In a series of rulings following Richmond Newspapers , the Supreme Court reaffirmed the existence of this constitutional right of access and defined its scope. In Globe Newspaper Co. v. Superior Court (1982), the court said that the right to attend a criminal trial applies even during the testimony of a minor victim of a sex crime. The court in that case struck down as unconstitutional a Massachusetts statute mandating closed proceedings during all such testimony, saying that the First Amendment right of access requires a judge to determine on a case-by-case basis whether the privacy concerns of a particular victim outweigh the public's right to attend and observe the proceedings. In 1984, the Supreme Court held that the right of public access extends to the proceedings to select a jury in a criminal case, Press-Enterprise Co. v. Superior Ct. I , and two years later said the right extends to preliminary hearings in a criminal prosecution. Press-Enterprise Co. v Superior Ct. II . The First Amendment protects the public's right to attend such judicial proceedings unless specific findings are made, on the record, demonstrating that a closed proceeding is essential in order to \"preserve higher values,\" and any limitation imposed on public access must be narrowly tailored to serve that interest. In 2010, in Presley v. Georgia , the court held a trial judge must ensure that these standards are satisfied before a courtroom is closed to the public, even if no one objects to the closure. While the Supreme Court has not substantively revisited the right of access in detail since 1986, lower federal and state courts have considered and applied the right to a wide variety of judicial and administrative proceedings over the intervening years. Courts have recognized a constitutional right to attend a given type of proceeding if public access will generally play a positive role in the performance of the proceeding (encouraging diligent attention by officials, ensuring that proper procedures are followed, preventing perjury or other misconduct, facilitating public understanding of decisions made), and if it is the type of proceeding that historically has been open to the public. This right has been held also to apply to administrative proceedings conducted like trials, such as deportation hearings and agency adjudications. The constitutional right is generally recognized to apply to all aspects of a criminal prosecution, except to matters involving a grand jury. Grand jury investigations historically have been completely secret, and this secrecy itself advances the important public policy of protecting innocent people in those cases where an investigation does not result in any criminal charge being filed. The right of access has been held to extend to civil trials and proceedings, although in some states there are important exceptions. Family Court proceedings, for example, raise significant privacy concerns, as do juvenile delinquency matters, and these are often closed to the public. – Limits on constitutional access As noted, the constitutional right to attend government proceedings is not absolute. That a First Amendment right protects public access to a type of proceeding does not mean that such a proceeding can never be closed to the press and public. The Supreme Court has identified four factors that must each be satisfied before the right of access may be restricted: 1. Those who want to close a proceeding must prove that holding a public proceeding would directly threaten some compelling interest, such as a defendant's right to a fair trial or the right of privacy, that outweighs the public interest in openness. 2. There must be no alternative short of closing the proceeding that could protect the threatened interest. 3. Any limitation on access must be as narrow as possible. 4. The limitation imposed must be effective in protecting the threatened interest or else closure may not be ordered. Applying these factors, courts have required journalists and the public to be excluded from proceedings in a number of situations, such as during the testimony of a sexual assault victim whose identity has not previously been disclosed to the public, or during testimony by an undercover police officer whose effectiveness or safety would be jeopardized by public identification. Sidebar conferences between the attorneys and the judge generally involve discussions intended to be kept confidential from the jury, but these discussions should usually be available to the press. A transcript is generally kept of such sidebar discussions and should be available for inspection as part of the record of the proceeding. To withhold the transcript of such a sidebar conference held during an open proceeding, the same four-part test would need to be met. One recurring but unsettled issue concerns reporters' access to information identifying jurors, and their right to speak to jurors after a verdict. The Supreme Court has said specifically that the First Amendment right of access extends to jury selection proceedings, where names and other identifying information are normally disclosed. Some lower courts have concluded that this principle also requires disclosures of written juror questionnaires when they are used. Nonetheless, in some high profile cases such as the prosecutions of Martha Stewart, Michael Jackson, Illinois Gov. Rod Blagojevich, and baseball slugger Barry Bonds, courts have sought to keep the identities of jurors private during the trial or to minimize press contact with jurors following a verdict. Sometimes a judge will conduct jury selection by reference only to juror numbers, to prevent public disclosure of juror names or addresses before a trial is over. The U.S. Court of Appeals in Philadelphia concluded in United States v. Wecht (2008) that the public access right requires juror names to be disclosed before the start of a trial, but this position is not universally embraced. In other cases, courts have barred reporters from speaking with jurors long after a verdict is returned. Limitations on disclosure of juror identities before a verdict is returned are sometimes permitted, but restrictions after a verdict is returned can rarely be squared with the First Amendment right of access. Reporters confronted with such court orders should seek legal advice on the validity of the restriction imposed. – What to say if a hearing is about to be closed without prior notice Because a constitutional right is at stake, the press has a right to be heard before a proceeding is closed to the public. The following statement should be read in court when confronted with an attempt to close a hearing without advance notice. It allows a reporter, when permitted to address the court, to state the basic concerns and to seek time for counsel to appear to make the legal argument. Any parts of the statement that are not applicable to a specific case can be changed or omitted: May it please the Court, I am (name) of The Associated Press (or other news organization). I respectfully request the opportunity to register on the record an objection to closing this proceeding to the public. The Associated Press (or other organization) requests a hearing at which its counsel may present to the Court legal authority and arguments showing why any closure in this proceeding would be improper. The press and the public have a constitutional right to attend judicial proceedings, and may not be excluded unless the Court makes findings, on the record, that: (1) closure is required to preserve a compelling constitutional interest, (2) no adequate alternatives to closure exist, and (3) the closure ordered is narrowly tailored to protect the threatened interest effectively. The Associated Press (or other news organization) submits that these findings cannot be made here, especially given the public interest in this proceeding. The public has a right to be informed of what transpires in this case, the positions being argued by the parties, and the factual basis for rulings made by the Court. The Court should avoid any impression that justice is being carried on in secret. The Associated Press (or other news organization) objects to any closure order and respectfully requests a hearing at which it can present full legal arguments and authority in support of this position. Thank you. If the court will not allow a reporter to be heard, a brief written statement – handwritten is fine – should be delivered to the courtroom clerk, making these same points. – A word about gag orders The tension between the right of a free press and the right of a fair trial is nothing new. Finding an impartial jury for the treason trial of Aaron Burr in 1807 was difficult, the Supreme Court has noted, because few people in Virginia \"had not formed some opinions concerning Mr. Burr or his case, from newspaper accounts.\" Nonetheless, an apparently increasing number of cases involving celebrity defendants or notorious crimes generating intense publicity have led to an increased number of orders preventing lawyers, parties to a case, and sometimes even witnesses, from discussing the case outside of the courtroom. The Supreme Court has said that speech by attorneys, as officers of the court, may be regulated to protect the integrity of the judicial system. Orders more broadly barring the speech of other trial participants, including the parties and witnesses, are permitted only when absolutely necessary to ensure an accused's right to a fair trial. Such orders have been entered in cases involving extraordinary press coverage that threatens the ability to select an impartial jury, when other measures are not likely to mitigate the effects of unrestrained pretrial publicity. A typical gag order does not prevent a reporter from asking questions, but it does bar trial participants and court officers from answering them. Because a gag order restricts access to news, most courts acknowledge that a reporter has legal standing to challenge an order, and may be successful if a gag order was entered without adequate factual findings to justify the need for the specific restraint on speech imposed by the court, or if the order is overbroad in the categories of individuals restrained or the range of topics they are prohibited from discussing. – Media protocols in high-profile cases Over the years \"decorum orders\" have been entered by some courts to regulate the conduct of reporters covering high profile trials. Sometimes requested by the parties and sometimes imposed unilaterally by the court, these orders may restrict the use of cameras and recording devices at specific locations in and around the courthouse, direct that witnesses or jurors not be photographed as they come and go from court, restrict the use of cellphones, or impose other restrictions to protect the decorum of a trial and operations at the courthouse. In the aborted Kobe Bryant prosecution, for example, a Colorado state judge imposed a decorum order specifying such details as where cameras could be positioned outside the courthouse, limiting the times when reporters could enter or leave the courtroom, and specifying where reporters could sit, where they could park their cars and how they could enter the courthouse. Restrictions on the actions of journalists that directly affect their ability to gather news must be narrowly tailored to protect a compelling governmental interest. Decorum orders that become necessary in high-profile cases to ensure safety, protect physical access to the courts by the public, or prevent interference with the integrity of the proceedings in the courtroom, are likely to be allowed as long as their terms are reasonable, content-neutral and limited to clearly defined restrictions on conduct within the courthouse and its immediate environs. A decorum order likely goes too far, however, if it also controls the content of a news report rather than just the conduct of a reporter. For example, for privacy reasons a court might restrict the taking of photographs of jurors as they enter or leave the courthouse, but could not properly bar the press from ever publishing the image of a juror, even if it were obtained through other sources. One restriction is limited to conduct at the courthouse; the other is aimed at the content of a news report. – The right to attend other types of proceedings In some instances, the constitutional right of access has been held to extend to proceedings beyond court hearings. For example, the U.S. Court of Appeals in Cincinnati has held that the public had a constitutional right to attend deportation proceedings conducted by the Immigration and Naturalization Service. ( Detroit Free Press v. Ashcroft , 2002.) The U.S. Court of Appeals in New York has held that the right of access applies in transit agency tribunals to assess fines. ( New York Civ. Lib. Union v. N.Y.C. Transit Authority , (2011). The First Amendment right of access similarly has been found to extend to military courts-martial, proceedings of judicial review boards and hearings of the Federal Mine Safety and Health Administration. Most states and the federal government also have statutes known as \"open meetings laws\" or \"government in the sunshine\" acts that protect the right of the public and the press to attend meetings of public authorities. These laws essentially provide that every meeting where a public board or public authority convenes to conduct business must be open to the public, with only limited exception. The federal law, for example, allows a meeting to be closed only if one of 10 identified categories of information is to be discussed, such as personnel and salary decisions. Even when a portion of a meeting is closed, a transcript or minutes must be prepared, and must be disclosed to the extent that disclosure would not reveal the exempt information. These access laws typically apply to executive agencies, but not to the legislative bodies, in most cases. Most state constitutions separately require open legislative sessions, although each house is usually free to make its own rules about access to committee meetings. – The right of access applies to court records The right of access generally includes the right to inspect transcripts of open proceedings, evidence introduced at a trial and most motion papers, orders and other records of open court proceedings. Some courts have concluded that this right to inspect judicial records is implicit in the First Amendment right of access, holding that the right covers any documents relating to a proceeding that is itself subject to the First Amendment right of access. Other courts analyze the right of access to documents filed with the court as a common law right that may be more easily restricted, sometimes with unfortunate results. For example, in the famous case of McConnell v. Federal Election Commission (2003), a challenge to the constitutionality of the McCain-Feingold campaign finance reform act was decided by the courts entirely on the basis of written submissions, without any public evidentiary hearing. A massive record of some 100,000 pages was presented to the court, apparently detailing the types of campaign abuses that Congress found to justify restrictions on election speech. Despite the public interest in knowing the factual basis for the competing arguments being made, the District of Columbia court concluded that the public had only a common law right to inspect the documents presented to the court, and that this right extended only to information \"relied upon\" by the court in reaching its decision. The court therefore rejected an application by several news organizations to inspect the evidence filed with the court, saying the public was only entitled to inspect specific pages of the record actually cited in the court's opinions. Other courts have rejected this limitation and have found a constitutional right of access to records submitted to courts in support of requests for judicial action, regardless of whether the court ultimately relies on the record, an approach embraced by the U.S. Court of Appeals in New York ( Lugosh v. Pyramid Corp. ). Whether the right to inspect court records is a constitutional right or a common law right is not fully settled in some areas of the country. Whatever the scope of the right to inspect court records, however, it does not generally extend to pretrial discovery documents and other litigation records that are not filed with the courts. While compelled public access to discovery has been afforded on rare occasions, involving highly newsworthy disputes, reporters generally have no right to require parties to a lawsuit to allow inspection of litigation material that is never filed with the court. – Access to other government records The federal Freedom of Information Act (FOIA), originally passed by Congress in 1966, creates a presumptive right of access to all documents held in the executive branch, other than documents in the possession of the president and his immediate staff. It does not cover Congress or the courts. All Cabinet agencies, independent agencies, regulatory commissions and government-owned corporations are covered. Records made available for inspection under the act include virtually anything recorded in a physical medium that can be reproduced. This includes all documents, papers, reports, and letters in the government's possession, as well as films, photographs, sound recordings, databases, computer disks and tapes. A 1996 law expanded FOIA to require federal agencies, whenever possible, to share data in a specific format, such as on computer diskette or CD-ROM. The 1996 amendments also broadened citizen access to government by placing more information directly online. The act contains nine exemptions that permit – but do not require – agencies to withhold information. Those exemptions are: (1) national security; (2) internal agency personnel rules; (3) information specifically exempt from disclosure by another law; (4) trade secrets; (5) internal agency memorandums and policy deliberations; (6) personal privacy; (7); law enforcement investigations; (8) federally regulated bank information; and (9) oil and gas well data. Different agencies apply these exemptions in different ways even when issues ostensibly have already been settled in court. If you want something, ask for it. Let the government decide whether it has any grounds or willingness to deny your request. The statutory exemptions allow information to be withheld, but do not require it. Even an exempt document can be released at the government's discretion. Because of the various exemptions, documents are often produced with large sections blacked out as \"exempt.\" And, because of a lack of manpower assigned to implement the act, there are often long delays in getting documents at all. Under the law, information is supposed to be produced within 20 days, but there is no effective enforcement mechanism when an agency misses this deadline, short of going to court. – Making a request under FOIA There is no set format for making a FOIA request for documents. Although most agencies have adopted regulations describing specific steps to follow, any reasonably precise identification of the information sought, submitted to the proper person, will trigger an obligation for an agency to respond. Here are a few elementary steps to consider in making a FOIA request that may help avoid problems: Call the public information office of the agency you believe has the records before filing your request, to make sure you have the right agency and the right address for filing it. Ask if the information you are seeking could be released without a written FOIA request. Be as specific as possible about what you want. Give dates, titles, and authors for documents if you know them. In your letter, provide your telephone number, email address, and offer to supply any other information that might help narrow the search. Even if you are using the letterhead stationery of a news organization, state specifically that you are a reporter for that organization and plan to use the material in news stories. The act does not require you to state your purpose, but disclosures in the public interest are eligible for fee waivers, exemption waivers and in some cases expedited handling. Request a waiver of search and copying fees. To avoid delays if the waiver is denied, also state a limit you are prepared to pay, such as $100, without the agency's need to obtain your prior, specific consent. If you want field office files checked as well as those at headquarters, be sure to request that specifically. Some agencies, such as the FBI, will not check beyond the office where the request is submitted, unless asked. It is good practice to send a separate request directly to the FOI officer at the field office of an agency in any event, if you think relevant documents exist there. Ask the agency to cite specific exemptions for each item it withholds in the event that any part of the request is denied. Request that redacted copies of documents be provided if only a specific portion of a document is subject to an exemption. If your initial request is denied, file an administrative appeal. Some agencies take a very different view on appeal. The denial letter will specify to whom the appeal must be sent and the deadline for making an appeal. If you do not first pursue an administrative appeal, you cannot go to court to compel release of the information. An appeal can be made through a simple letter that explains why the public will benefit from disclosure and asks for a review of the grounds on which the request was denied. Several exemptions require a balancing of private and public interests, and reviewers on an administrative appeal may be more likely to exercise their right to waive an exemption if a good case for disclosure is made. You may want to consult FOIA experts or manuals before proceeding with a request. A FOI Service Center is maintained by the Reporters Committee for Freedom of the Press. The committee publishes a pamphlet with sample FOIA letters and appeal forms as well as analyses of the act. (Available on the web at: http://www.rcfp.org/foiact/index.html.) The committee maintains a toll-free hot line (800-336-4243), 24 hours a day, seven days a week, with attorneys available to provide FOIA advice to journalists. On the web, the U.S. Department of Justice publishes a \"Guide to the Freedom of Information Act,\" which gives the current government understanding of what is covered and not covered by each exemption, http://www.justice.gov/oip/foia-guide.html. Also on the web, the U.S. Department of Justice publishes a collection of \"FOIA Resources,\" which includes up-to-date copies of relevant statutes and recent court decisions, http://www.justice.gov/oip/foia-resources.html. It is advisable to check on specific state freedom of information laws. Each individual state has its own freedom of information laws that apply to state and local government agencies."}
{"source_url": "https://www.apstylebook.com/ap_stylebook/introduction", "entry_header": "Introduction", "text_content": "The courts significantly changed the legal standards governing the work of reporters and editors during the era of the civil rights movement and the Vietnam War, applying the First Amendment's protection of speech and press with new force and meaning. In New York Times v. Sullivan (1964), the Supreme Court held for the first time that the First Amendment limits the ability of states to impose damages for the publication of a statement even when it is false, in some circumstances. Sixteen years later, in Richmond Newspapers v. Virginia (1980), the court reached the equally unprecedented conclusion that the First Amendment establishes an affirmative right of the press and public to compel access to certain information concerning the exercise of government power. The fallout from these two watershed cases has reshaped a great deal of the law that governs the publication of the news and the way it is gathered. This chapter addresses some of the key legal issues facing journalists. With respect to newsgathering activity , it explores three topics of direct significance: Access to government information , including the rules governing reporter access to the courts and to government information generally; Confidential sources , including the law relating to promises of confidentiality and the reporter's privilege; and Newsgathering conduct , including common law and statutory rules that may create liability for actions taken while a reporter is seeking out the news. With respect to news content , this chapter addresses the legal principles in three branches of the law that govern liability for the publication of information: Defamation , including the elements of a claim arising from the publication of a false statement, and the common law and constitutional defenses to liability; Privacy , including claims for the disclosure of private facts, misappropriation and \"false light,\" which can arise when the facts reported are true ; and Copyright infringement , including the elements of a copyright claim and the \"fair use\" defense. While the law can vary in significant ways from one state to another, particularly in its details, the broad principles affecting newsgathering and reporting in the United States are largely consistent, due in part to the federal constitutional principles protecting speech and the press that overlay state law. Reporters and editors naturally will become familiar over time with the particulars of media law in the places where they work, and this chapter is intended only as a general primer on some basic principles that are likely to apply across a range of situations. It should not be construed as legal advice and should not substitute for obtaining legal guidance when you are in doubt."}

Many broadcast stories can be effectively told using such straightforward writing and this simple structure: Lead --> Backup --> Details --> Background For example: A huge wildfire in eastern Arizona is expected to spread to New Mexico. Both wind and dry lightning are forecast over the next two days. Arizona fire officials say more than 1,000 firefighters are working the blaze. There have been no serious injuries, but hundreds of people have been evacuated, and 11 buildings have been destroyed. The fire has burned more than 350 square miles.

The first sentence in this story reports the essential facts that are the news: A huge wildfire [ the subject of the story ] in eastern Arizona [ location ] is expected to spread to New Mexico [ the story's latest development ]. Backup. The second sentence \"backs up\" the lead: Both wind and dry lightning are forecast over the next two days [ answers the implied question \"Why is the fire expected to spread?\" ]. Details. These next sentences report additional important facts -- mainly, the extent to which people are injured or at risk.

The fire story follows principles used by AP's broadcast writers: 1. Lead with the news. The story first reports its latest newsworthy development. If the latest development had been evacuations, the lead would have been: \"Hundreds of people are being evacuated because of a huge wildfire in eastern Arizona.\" 2. In leads, use forms of the present or future verb tenses. \"The fire is expected to spread,\" not \"The fire was expected to spread today.\" But don't write in the simple present tense \"headline\" style: \"Twelve buildings are destroyed in a wildfire.\" Present perfect tense sounds more natural: \"A wildfire has destroyed 12 buildings.\" 3. Keep leads short and to the point. It's easy for listeners and viewers to miss details. Use the lead to introduce a story, and save details for subsequent sentences. 4. Favor the active voice. \"Firefighters are working the blaze,\" not \"the blaze is being worked by firefighters.\" 5. Attribute at the beginning of sentences. \"Fire officials say...,\" not \"...said fire officials.\" 6. Identify newsmakers before naming them. Write: \"Fire information officer Ed Toby,\" not \"Ed Toby, the fire information officer, says...\" 7. Omit needless words. \"It's the third-largest fire in Arizona's history,\" not \"This particular blaze is the third-largest in the history of the state of Arizona.\" 8. Prefer the simple to the complex. \"Fire\" or \"blaze\" but not \"conflagration.\" 9. Don't strain for synonyms. \"Arizona,\" not \"the state.\" Someone who hears \"...in the state's history\" might not have heard the rest of the story. 10. Use direct quotes only when a paraphrase doesn't work better. In most cases, it does. \"There have been no serious injuries,\" not, \"Toby says, 'Two people reported bruises and five others pulled muscles carrying heavy suitcases while being evacuated, but otherwise no one was hurt.'\" 11. Simplify numbers. \"More than 350 square miles,\" not \"352.67 square miles.\" 12. Use a variety of sentence lengths, but keep most of them short. The sentences in the fire story are 8, 9, 12, 13, 13 and 19 words long - and that's counting every word, including \"a.\" A radio story on the fire could include recorded sound of a newsmaker talking: ( Reporter ) A huge wildfire in eastern Arizona is expected to spread to New Mexico. Both wind and dry lightning are forecast over the next two days. Arizona fire officials say more than 1,000 firefighters are working the blaze. Fire information officer Ed Toby says still more may be needed: ( Newsmaker ) \"We already have firefighters from New York, Colorado and Texas helping us. We might bring some more in from California.\" ( Reporter ) There have been no serious injuries, but hundreds of people have been evacuated, and 11 buildings have been destroyed. The fire has burned more than 350 square miles. It's the third-largest wildfire in Arizona's history. Always identify newsmakers before their voices are heard. Give a general sense of the subject of the upcoming sound bite, but don't \"parrot.\" Write: \"Toby says still more may be needed,\" not \"Toby says firefighters from New York, Colorado and Texas are already helping.\" A video story might incorporate not only sound and video, but also locator maps and graphics: ( Reporter reading over animated map showing fire's location ) A huge wildfire in eastern Arizona is expected to spread to New Mexico. ( Over video of fire ) Both wind and dry lightning are forecast over the next two days. ( Over video of firefighters working ) Arizona fire officials say more than 1,000 firefighters are working the blaze. Still more may be needed: ( On-screen identification, seen over shot of newsmaker talking ) Ed Toby Fire Information Officer \"We already have firefighters from New York, Colorado and Texas helping us. We might bring some more in from California.\" ( Reporter reading over shots of people evacuating; then shots of destroyed buildings ) There have been no serious injuries, but hundreds of people have been evacuated, and 11 buildings have been destroyed. ( Reporter on-camera, with fire burning in distance ) The fire has burned more than 350 square miles. It's the third-largest wildfire in Arizona's history. A grasp of these basic concepts will help you go on to create more complicated stories, whether for wires, radio, video or new media. Corrections, correctives, clarifications Factual errors in AP video stories need to be immediately repaired with either a CORRECTION if the story is in that six-hour news cycle, or a CORRECTIVE if the time from the error having occurred to setting the record straight extends beyond six hours. Both a CORRECTION and a CORRECTIVE must begin with an Editor's Note citing the date of the story's original publication, the original story keyword (or slug) and the specifics of the error. If the error being corrected is of a serious enough nature to materially change the original item, a story KILL should be immediately sent stating: Please KILL the story filed from Switzerland on World Peace on January 31, 2017, titled SWIWORLDPEACE20173101. A replacement item, correcting a material error, will run shortly. In a CORRECTION, write a brief description of what has gone wrong and how it has been changed. For example: Editor's Note: Please replace the shotlist and storyline in SYRIA FIGHTING first transmitted today Jan. 31 at 1038GMT and slugged SYR FIGHTING 20170131 . This version corrects that the fighting took place in a southern suburb of Idlib and not in the heart of the city as was initially reported. In a CORRECTIVE where the error is being fixed in a subsequent news cycle – beyond six hours – a similar approach should be taken but a more detailed explanation may be needed depending on the nature of the mistake. For example: Editor's Note: On Jan. 31, 2017, The Associated Press published a story from Switzerland titled SWI WORLD PEACE 20170131 which incorrectly named Fred Smith as chairman of the Committee for World Peace and described the comments he made as the official view of the organization. Smith in fact held no formal office within the organization, having resigned his position at an earlier meeting. He was participating in the gathering in support of the organization's ideals, but his comments were his personal view and not made formally as a spokesman of, or office bearer on, the committee. In the case of a CORRECTION, it shall be at the discretion of the senior manager in charge of video production whether the video itself needs to be retransmitted to customers. Updating the script and shotlist may be sufficient. In the case of a CORRECTIVE where changes were necessary to the video or the script/shotlist, all stories must be retransmitted. In circumstances where a clarification is required but no inaccuracy needs correcting, issue an Editor's Note slugged with the term CLARIFICATION. A rewritten script and shot list should be sent specifying what is clarified in the updated version. So, for example, we might say: \"This version clarifies the people seen in shot 7 were villagers heading from the conflict who were given food by an aid agency rather than locals who lived near the aid agency feeding station, as originally stated based on initial information.\" Correctives, corrections and clarifications need to be published and posted."}

Always use figures. See fractions . Break out recipes in list and instruction format. Do not write as regular text. Use figures for all quantities in recipes. Do not use abbreviations. Spell out teaspoon , tablespoon , etc. Following is the format for recipes: – The title of the recipe is capitalized. – Start to finish time goes below the title, noting estimate for active time in parentheses if hands-off cooking time is significantly longer than active prep time. – Savory recipes that call for measured amounts of salt should always refer to kosher salt, 1 1/2 teaspoons kosher salt . Recipes for baked goods should call for table salt, 2 teaspoons salt , as table salt is the preferred ingredient for baking. Recipes that do not specify volume can simply call for salt, salt and ground black pepper . – The number of servings appears next. – List ingredients in the order used and spell out all measurements. When appropriate, unusual ingredients can be clarified within the list, ghee (clarified butter) . – Use numerals for all measurements, times and oven settings. Exception: When two numbers follow one another, write out the first for clarity, two 12-ounce cans . – Instructions for making the recipe follow, and should be written in short, easy-to-digest paragraphs. – When an oven is used, Preheat the oven to 350 F , should be the first line of the method (unless the oven is not used until more than 30 minutes after the start of the recipe). – Begin sentences with equipment and technique, rather than ingredients. In a medium saucepan over low heat, whisk together the butter and sugar. – Nutrition information, if available, follows the method. – If the recipe source is not the bylined writer of the story, the source should appear at the bottom in parentheses: (Recipe from John Smith's \"Book of Recipes,\" Recipe Publishers, 2007.)

Lightly spritz 2 baking sheets with cooking spray. In a large skillet over medium-high, heat the oil. Add the chard, onion, red pepper flakes and garlic. Saute until the chard is wilted, about 8 minutes. Set aside. Divide the dough into 4 pieces. On a lightly floured surface, roll out each to the size of a dinner plate. Place 2 rounds of dough on each baking sheet. Top each piece of dough with a quarter of the chard mixture, spreading it evenly. Top with the prosciutto, then crumble goat cheese over each pizza. Bake for 12 minutes, or until the crust is lightly puffed, but not browned. Crack an egg into the center of each pizza, then bake for another 12 minutes, or until the whites are cooked but the yolks are still runny. Serve immediately.

We also cover the criminal justice system to shine a light on the lives of victims of violence and reveal problems and injustices. This journalism requires precise language and care in reporting. Our reporting methods and approach, as well as our visuals and words, should always be thoughtful. Criminal justice reporting and writing also requires a commitment to fairness by always giving a person accused of a crime the opportunity to comment, following up on crime stories throughout the justice system, and highlighting instances in which a person’s name has been cleared. It requires cultivating a diversity of sources and always working to verify information provided by law enforcement or other authorities. And often it calls for accountability journalism: looking for warning signs that might have been missed; law enforcement response; weapon issues; what might be done to prevent similar crimes in the future. FAIRNESS A fundamental principle of the criminal justice system is that all people accused of crimes are presumed to be innocent until they have been proven guilty in court. That principle should also be central to newsrooms’ coverage of crime and courts, in line with key journalistic principles of balance and accuracy. When considering whether to write about an arrest or criminal charges, ask yourself: Will I follow this case until the end? If not, you may not know if the charges are later dropped or if the suspect was acquitted. If it is a minor crime and you are unlikely to follow up with coverage about the outcome of the case, consider not naming the suspect in the story or not writing about the case at all. It also is essential when writing about someone charged with a crime to get a response from the accused person, their attorney, a family member or another representative. If sufficient efforts are made to speak to a representative for the defendant and no one is available or they decline to comment, we must highlight in stories the efforts taken to reflect the point of view of the person who is accused. This must be done even when covering a defendant’s guilty plea or conviction. It is not about checking a box but about upholding our commitment to fairness. In breaking news situations, a story can be published without a suspect’s name if there is not enough time to make sufficient efforts to reach someone to comment on their behalf. Unless the suspect is a prominent person, their name may not be the highest-value news in a story. It can be added later once we have tried to reach a lawyer, family member or another representative who can speak on their behalf. Be aware of your own unconscious biases, particularly when framing angles and approaches that may inadvertently vary depending on the race, gender and other characteristics of both the suspect and the victims. For example: calling an 18-year-old white suspect a teen and an 18-year-old Black suspect a man. (Best to use just the age in both cases.) INITIAL REPORTS; SOURCE DEVELOPMENT; DEEPER CONTEXT Be cautious about initial news releases or statements from law enforcement or other officials. Accounts by police, especially in the hours just after a crime, are very incomplete and can be inaccurate, whether about specific details or about motivations behind the crime. Press for details and substantiation: How do they know? If key details aren’t known or can’t be confirmed, say so in the story. Attribute carefully and thoroughly. If descriptions change, say so. For example: The police chief initially said the shooting was not a hate crime, without explaining that conclusion, but later said she believes the victim’s race was the motivation. She said the suspect had posted racist rants on social media. Also remember that police may release information before officials review  footage from body cameras, dashboard cameras, surveillance cameras or bystanders’ cameras. What they see later in that footage may change the story. That’s why it is crucial to always work to verify and corroborate official accounts by talking to witnesses, victims, relatives and other sources. Use verified or vetted user-generated content to give you eyes and ears on the ground if you can’t be at the scene. Look for livestreamed videos and call nearby homes and businesses to find additional details for your coverage. (AP staff should consult with Standards editors and the Nerve Center before publishing any livestreamed video or content created by the suspect. See below on dealing with graphic material.) Local or state governmental representatives like mayors or school board members are often briefed on situations and can help provide information that can keep the public safe or provide insight into investigations. Trauma care doctors and centers can provide context about the response to mass violence and other traumatic events in the weeks after the initial emergency. And agencies like the Red Cross can often help describe the scope of events through the needs they are seeing and the response they are organizing. Victim advocacy groups, anti-violence advocates and social justice advocates can also be important sources. Neighborhood groups or businesses can add needed context or nuance in stories about police violence. Reaching witnesses on social media or contacting family representatives or civil rights attorneys can shed light on gaps in information that comes from law enforcement sources. Other law enforcement agencies aiding in an investigation can be helpful sources. In stories about mass shootings or high-profile prisoner escapes, for example, other assisting law enforcement organizations include federal agencies like the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives or the U.S. Marshals Service, neighboring police departments, or state police. These agencies and departments can help vet information, add deeper context with their expertise or help us gain a deeper understanding of events. They may know the kinds of weapons recovered or used, or the response times. They could help dispel misinformation that develops sometimes on social media regarding large events. It is crucial to stay in touch with sources when news is not breaking. If law enforcement, anti-violence advocates or other sources hear from a journalist only after a crime, they may feel exploited or see the relationship as merely transactional. In many circumstances, we report more accurately on criminal justice issues when community sources see us as reliable, caring and trustworthy. INTERVIEWING VICTIMS AND FAMILY MEMBERS We want to include the voices of victims, survivors and their family members. But we want to be sensitive in our questions and approach. See these tips from the Dart Center for Journalism and Trauma: https://dartcenter.org/resources/tips-interviewing-victims-tragedy-witnesses-and-survivors MUG SHOTS We do not publish mug shots simply because of the appearance of the person who is accused, nor do we cover a story driven by a particularly embarrassing mug shot. Many viewers and readers associate mug shots with guilt — even if the person has not been convicted or even gone to trial yet. Because of that, mug shots should not be the lead image or only photo linked to a story in most cases or appear as the lead visual or thumbnail on consumer-facing video. In the AP, exceptions may be made in consultation with the Standards team or Nerve Center. Generally do not use the suspect’s mug shot, or any photo of the suspect, as the first photo in a sequence or gallery, or prominently in a video. But consider the nature of a given story. If the suspect is at large and being sought, that could change the decision. If the trial is beginning or ending, that also could be a factor. If in doubt, AP staff should consult with the Nerve Center or the Standards team. After a person has been convicted, the mug shot or other photo of the person may be used as the first photo in a gallery when appropriate to the nature of the story. But again, consider the type of story, especially those about a victim’s life, the victim’s family, survivors and other angles. Also see the next section on dealing with graphic material. GRAPHIC MATERIAL Consider: What public good is served by including graphic details or images of violence, abuse or death? Does each detail advance the story or people’s understanding of what happened; or does it serve just to shock and push people away without accomplishing anything? The answers can vary depending on the specific detail or image, or the specific story. Are those details necessary to understand the story? Or are they outweighed by potential harm to survivors, families, communities? We want to accurately depict and explain what happened. But that doesn’t necessarily mean including every detail or image that we have. Also consider the impact to the journalists who view graphic images or videos. Aim to limit the number of people who may see them. This may mean a small email group or other limited sharing. Warn colleagues of graphic content — including visuals and words — when sharing a link or photo in a company messaging app like Slack or Microsoft Teams. Newsroom leaders are encouraged to offer mental health resources and other support for journalists who view such images, and allow them to opt out. In the AP, if you are asked to deal with such images, you can decline. Think about your own mental health before handling, or seeking out, brutal imagery. The same goes for any scenario in covering these events, including talking with relatives or members of the community. LANGUAGE Consider the difference between details that give meaning and context to a story vs. details or word choices that may be “colorful” but also gratuitous or even offensive. Avoid language that carries a negative connotation or stereotype, like describing a neighborhood as gritty . Decide if such descriptions are relevant, and why. If used, give specifics rather than general labels that may be just stereotypes. As the Stylebook’s race-related coverage guidance notes: “Be aware that some words and phrases that seem innocuous to one group can carry negative connotations, even be seen as slurs, to another. As with all news coverage, be sensitive to your varied audiences and their different perceptions of language and the larger world.” For instance, if a homeless person is accused of a crime, mention their city of residence, if available, the same way you would for anyone else: Roberts, of Los Angeles, was charged , not Roberts, who has no permanent address, was charged . And not: A homeless man was charged … Write that the man was arrested a block from his home , not the man was arrested a block from his mobile home . Be aware that many people see thug as code for a racial slur; Black boy has a loaded history and should be avoided in referring to Black males of any age; unarmed Black man could be seen as assuming the default is for Black men to be armed. Do not write in a way that assumes white is default. Not: The officer is accused of choking Owens, who is Black . Instead: The white officer is accused of choking Owens, who is Black . Use caution when describing a certain person as a killer, murderer, thief , etc., even after a conviction. A conviction may be overturned, the person may be otherwise exonerated, the person may have been wrongfully convicted, etc. Another option is to use person-first language: Joe Smith, who was convicted of killing Jane Smith, is appealing his sentence , instead of convicted killer Joe Smith is appealing his sentence . THE TERMS SHOOTER, KILLER, GUNMAN General references to the shooter, the killer, the gunman , etc., are acceptable: The police chief said the shooter fired 15 rounds. But in most cases, don’t write the shooter in reference to the specific person, or use wording such as Smith fired 15 shots in killing his wife and son , unless the shooter also died or has been convicted. For example, if the person is alive and not convicted, do not write: The police chief said the shooter worked at XYZ for six months until he was fired a week ago . Instead, use the term suspect in such a case. Avoid the term alleged shooter . There can be exceptions, notably if the shooter livestreamed the attacks, or posted extensively about their involvement, or in other ways left no question about their identity. In the AP, discuss such exceptions with the Standards team and Nerve Center. See the next section with cautions on the use of such material. The term gunman is acceptable, if the person is or was male and an adult. However, in the early stages of an investigation, information about the person’s gender may be incorrect. So use caution with this term. SUSPECT’S WRITINGS, LIVESTREAMS Limit use of the perpetrator’s writings (don’t call them manifestos) and social media postings. Summarize rather than quote directly unless the quotation itself is clearly relevant. Generally avoid use of the person’s livestreaming; in the AP, discuss with Standards editors and the Nerve Center. CRIME DATA Avoid repeating claims or rhetoric about crime rates or trends and instead, turn to data as needed for a story. Journalists should also consider other data sources and points of view not necessarily captured by crime data — which is often incomplete, especially at the national level — and cultivate community sources to reflect other relevant context for crime trends. TRANSGENDER PEOPLE Use the gender, pronouns and name a transgender person goes by or went by in public life, which is not always the same as those on legal or medical documents. Use a transgender person’s previous name or pretransition image only if required to understand the news or if requested by the person. Use of previous names is often called deadnaming and can be insensitive, offensive and traumatizing. When covering transgender people, including in stories about crimes or accidents that resulted in the person’s death, be cognizant that authorities or family members may be ignorant of or be disregarding the person’s wishes about their name or pronouns. When possible, take into account information given by the person or by friends or others who may have better knowledge about how the person lived and identified. In the AP, use of a transgender person’s previous name must be approved by the Standards team or Nerve Center. See gender, sex and sexual orientation .

To avoid any suggestion that a person is being judged before a trial, do not use a phrase such as alleged killer Ralph Hornsby ; the alleged killer ; suspected shooter Carmine Jablonski ; the suspected shooter , etc. Instead: Ralph Hornsby, charged with killing the man. Alford plea A plea in which a defendant pleads guilty to a charge but maintains their innocence. Explain the term if used in a story. allege The word must be used with great care. Some guidelines: Avoid any suggestion that the writer is making an allegation. Specify the source of an allegation. In a criminal case, it should be an arrest record, an indictment or the statement of a public official connected with the case. Use alleged bribe or similar phrase when necessary to make it clear that an unproved action is not being treated as fact. Be sure that the source of the charge is specified elsewhere in the story. Avoid, where possible, alleged victim . It is too easily construed as skepticism of a victim’s account. Avoid redundant uses of alleged . It is proper to say: The district attorney alleged that she took a bribe . Or: The district attorney accused her of taking a bribe . But not: The district attorney accused her of allegedly taking a bribe . Do not use alleged to describe an event that is known to have occurred, when the dispute is over who participated in it. Do not say: He attended the alleged meeting when what you mean is: He allegedly attended the meeting . Do not use alleged as a routine qualifier. Instead, use a word such as apparent , ostensible or reputed . For guidelines on related words, see accused, alleged, suspected ; arrest ; and indict . arrest To avoid any suggestion that someone is being judged before a trial, do not use a phrase such as arrested for killing . Instead, use arrested on a charge of killing . If a charge hasn’t been filed, arrested on suspicion of , or a similar phrase, should be used. For guidelines on related words, see accused, alleged, suspected ; allege ; indict ; sue . assassin, killer, murderer An assassin is one who kills a prominent person for political reasons, material gain or devotion to a cause. A killer is anyone who kills with a motive of any kind. A murderer is one who is convicted of murder in a court of law. Do not use these terms for specific suspects until they have been convicted or pleaded guilty — and use caution when describing a certain person as a killer, murderer or assassin even after a conviction. A conviction may be overturned, the person may be otherwise exonerated, the person may have been wrongfully convicted, etc. Another option is to use person-first language: Joe Smith, who was convicted of killing Jane Smith, is appealing his sentence , instead of convicted killer Joe Smith is appealing his sentence . Do not use phrasing such as accused murderer or accused killer . See homicide, murder, manslaughter . assault, battery Assault almost always implies physical contact and sudden, intense violence. Legally, however, assault means simply to threaten violence, as in pointing a pistol at an individual without firing it. Assault and battery is the legal term when the victim was touched by the assaulter or something the assaulter put in motion. bail Bail is money or property that will be forfeited to the court if an accused individual fails to appear for trial. It may be posted as follows: The person may deposit with the court the full amount or its equivalent in collateral such as a deed to property. A friend or relative may make such a deposit with the court. The accused person may pay a professional bail bondsman a percentage of the total figure. The bondsman, in turn, guarantees the court that it will receive from him the full amount in the event the individual fails to appear for trial. It is correct in all cases to say that an accused person posted bail or posted a bail bond (the money held by the court is a form of bond). When a distinction is desired, say that the individual posted his own bail , that bail was posted by a friend or relative , or that bail was obtained through a bondsman . body camera Preferred for cameras mounted on clothing, generally of law enforcers. When the condensed version appears in headlines or in quotes, it is bodycam , one word. burglary, larceny, robbery, theft Legal definitions of burglary vary, but in general a burglary involves entering a building (not necessarily by breaking in) and remaining unlawfully with the intention of committing a crime. Larceny is the legal term for the wrongful taking of property. Its nonlegal equivalents are stealing or theft . Robbery in the legal sense involves the use of violence or threat in committing larceny. In a wider sense it means to plunder or rifle , and may thus be used even if a person was not present: His house was robbed while he was away . Theft describes a larceny that did not involve threat, violence or plundering. USAGE NOTE: You rob a person, bank, house, etc., but you steal the money or the jewels. casualties Avoid using the word, which is vague and can refer to either injuries or deaths. Instead, be specific about what is meant. If authorities use the term, press for specifics. If specifics aren’t available, say so: Officer Riya Kumar said the shooting resulted in casualties, but she said she did not know whether any were deaths. child pornography Generally avoid the terms child pornography and child porn . Use them only when essential in direct quotations or excerpts from documents. Instead, describe such charges or allegations as possessing (or producing ) child sexual abuse images or possessing (or producing ) child sexual abuse material , including in headlines. See child sexual abuse images for more guidance. child sexual abuse images The preferred term, instead of child pornography or child porn , for sexually explicit visual content depicting someone under age 18. While the term child pornography appears in many state and federal laws, that phrasing should be avoided in news stories because it can diminish the seriousness of the crime and its impact on victims. Many advocacy groups and law enforcement agencies, including the U.S. Department of Justice, now prefer the term child sexual abuse material . Use material if some of the content is nonvisual or if the exact nature isn’t known. Do not refer to it in headlines or stories as CSAM , the acronym that is sometimes used. When possible, be precise about the case that is being described, with language such as photos depicting the sexual abuse of children, videos depicting the sexual exploitation of children or sexually explicit photos and videos of children . But avoid graphic descriptions of the images or other material. See child pornography . civil cases, criminal cases A civil case is one in which an individual, business or agency of government seeks damages or relief from another individual, business or agency of government. Civil actions generally involve a charge that a contract has been breached or that someone has been wronged or injured. A criminal case is one that the state or the federal government brings against an individual charged with committing a crime. commutation A legal term for a change of sentence or punishment to one that is less severe. See pardon, parole, probation . convict (v.) Follow with preposition of , not for : He was convicted of murder . Do not use convict or ex-con as a noun. See prison, jail, prisoner, inmate, people who are incarcerated . cop Be careful in the use of this colloquial term for police officer . It may be used in lighter stories and in casual, informal descriptions, but often is a derogatory term out of place in serious police stories. courthouse Capitalize with the name of a jurisdiction: the Cook County Courthouse, the U.S. Courthouse . Lowercase in other uses: the county courthouse, the courthouse, the federal courthouse . Court House (two words) is used in the proper names of some communities: Appomattox Court House, Virginia . cyberattack See the Technology chapter. defund To stop providing or to reduce funds, especially government funds, for a program, group, etc. The term defund the police often refers to taking funds from police departments to spend on other priorities such as employment programs, mental health services and social services to increase public safety. The term is sometimes misrepresented as abolishing police. Avoid using the term other than in a direct quotation; if used in a quotation, explain and provide detail about what is being sought. detective Do not abbreviate. Capitalize before a name only if it is a formal rank: police Detective Frank Serpico, private detective Richard Diamond . See titles . district attorney Capitalize when used as a formal title before a name: District Attorney Hamilton Burger . DA acceptable on second reference. See titles . drive-by (adj.) A drive-by shooting. DUI, DWI Abbreviations for driving under the influence or driving while intoxicated . Acceptable in all references. See drunk, drunken, drunkeness . execute, execution To execute a person is to kill that person in compliance with a military order or judicial decision. See assassin, killer, murderer and homicide, murder, manslaughter . execution-style Avoid use of this term to describe how people are killed, since it means different things to different people. Be specific as to how the person was killed, if that information is necessary. felony, misdemeanor A felony is a serious crime. A misdemeanor is a minor offense against the law. A fuller definition of what constitutes a felony or misdemeanor depends on the governmental jurisdiction involved. At the federal level, a misdemeanor is a crime that carries a potential penalty of no more than a year in jail. A felony is a crime that carries a potential penalty of more than a year in prison. Often, however, a statute gives a judge options such as imposing a fine or probation in addition to or instead of a jail or prison sentence. See prison, jail, prisoner, inmate, people who are incarcerated . firearms, guns, assault weapons Assault weapon is a political term that is often used by state and federal lawmakers to refer to types of semiautomatic rifles with certain features. States with assault weapons bans have varying definitions, but they generally refer to semiautomatic firearms with features such as a detachable magazine, pistol grip, a folding or detachable stock, or a threaded barrel. The terms assault weapons or assault rifles may be used in headlines and in first reference in a story because that is how the group of firearms has become commonly known. But high in the story, give specifics. For example: certain semiautomatic rifles referred to as assault weapons , or certain semiautomatic rifles commonly called assault weapons . Be as specific as possible about the types of guns at issue in any given law or story. Use the terms AR- or AK-style rifles when accurate. AR stands for Armalite Rifle , a nod to the company that designed the first one. AR-style rifles , the most common being the AR-15 style, are now made by numerous companies. AK-style is a different type of rifle based on the design of Mikhail Kalashnikova, the original creator of the AK-47 . Do not refer to assault weapons bans as bans on semiautomatic weapons , which encompasses many modern firearms not classified as assault weapons. Avoid the terms military-style rifles or modern sporting rifles . When reporting on guns, do not automatically repeat terms used by authorities, witnesses or others. Witnesses will often misinterpret the sound of a rapidly fired gun or base a description on the look of the weapon. Instead, seek specific and detailed information from authorities, such as a gun’s make, model, caliber and magazine capacity. For example, Authorities said the shooter used a Smith & Wesson M&P15 rifle or Authorities said the man used an AR-style semiautomatic rifle with a 30-round magazine . Use more generalized descriptions, such as rifle or handgun , until such details become available. Under federal law, automatic rifles are restricted in the United States to their manufacturers; licensed dealers; the military; law enforcement; and civilians who have special permission to own such weapons, provided that the weapons were imported or domestically manufactured before May 19, 1986. Other terms: anti-aircraft A cannon or other weapon designed for defense against air attack. The form: a 105 mm anti-aircraft gun . artillery A carriage-mounted cannon. automatic A firearm that reloads automatically after each shot. The term should not be used to describe the rate of fire. To avoid confusion, specify fully automatic or semiautomatic rather than simply automatic. Give the type of weapon or model for clarity. bolt-action rifle A manually operated handle on the barrel opens and closes the breech, ejecting a spent round, loading another and cocking the weapon for triggering. Popular for hunting and target-shooting. Example: Remington 700 . Some shotguns are bolt-action. buckshot See shot . bullet The projectile fired by a rifle, pistol or machine gun. Together with metal casing, primer and propellant, it forms a cartridge . caliber A measurement of the diameter of the inside of a gun barrel except for most shotguns. Measurement is in either millimeters or decimal fractions of an inch. The word caliber is not used when giving the metric measurement. The forms: a 9 mm pistol, a .22-caliber rifle . cannon A weapon, usually supported on some type of carriage, that fires explosive projectiles. The form: a 105 mm cannon . Plural is cannons . carbine A short, lightweight rifle, usually having a barrel length of less than 20 inches. The form: an M3 carbine . cartridge See bullet . clip Do not use this term unless in a quote. The correct term is magazine to describe the device used to store multiple rounds of ammunition together as a unit, ready for insertion into a firearm. A clip is a device that stores rounds together that can then be used to load bullets into a magazine . See magazine for a fuller description. Colt Named for Samuel Colt, it designates a make of weapon or ammunition developed for Colt handguns. The forms: a Colt .45-caliber revolver, .45 Colt ammunition . fully automatic A firearm that fires continuously as long as the trigger is depressed. Examples include machine guns and submachine guns . gauge The measure of the size of a shotgun. Gauge is expressed in terms of the number per pound of round lead balls with a diameter equal to the size of the barrel. The bigger the number, the smaller the shotgun. The forms: a 12-gauge shotgun, a .410 shotgun . The .410 actually is a caliber, but commonly is called a gauge. The ball leaving the barrel is 0.41” in diameter. ghost guns Privately made firearms that lack serial numbers used to trace them and are often purchased without a background check. Law enforcement officials have reported ghost guns have increasingly been used in violent crimes across the U.S. Avoid describing them as untraceable guns and instead say they are harder for law enforcement to trace. handgun A pistol or a revolver . howitzer A cannon shorter than a gun of the same caliber employed to fire projectiles at relatively high angles at a target, such as opposing forces behind a ridge. The form: a 105 mm howitzer . lever-action rifle A handle on the stock ejects and loads cartridges and cocks the rifle for triggering. A firearm often associated with the Old West. Example: Winchester 94 . M1, M16 These and similar combinations of a letter and figure(s) designate rifles used by the military. The forms: an M1 rifle, an M16 rifle . machine gun A fully automatic gun that fires as long as the trigger is depressed and bullets are chambered. Such a weapon is generally so large and heavy that it rests on the ground or a mount. A submachine gun is hand-held. The form: a .50-caliber Browning machine gun . magazine The ammunition storage and feeding device within or attached to a firearm. It may be fixed to the firearm or detachable. It is not a clip . Magnum A trademark for a type of high-powered cartridge with a larger case and a larger powder charge than other cartridges of approximately the same caliber. The form: a .357 Magnum, a .44 Magnum . mortar Device used to launch a mortar shell; it is the shell, not the mortar, that is fired. musket A heavy, large-caliber shoulder firearm fired by means of a matchlock, a wheel lock, a flintlock or a percussion lock. Its ammunition is a musket ball. pistol A handgun that can be a single-shot or a semiautomatic. Differs from a revolver in that the chamber and barrel are one integral part. Its size is measured in calibers. The form: a .45-caliber pistol . revolver A handgun. Differs from a pistol in that cartridges are held in chambers in a cylinder that revolves through the barrel. The form: a .45-caliber revolver . rifle A firearm designed or made to be fired from the shoulder and having a rifled bore. It uses bullets or cartridges for ammunition. Its size is measured in calibers. The form: a .22-caliber rifle . Saturday night special A compact, relatively inexpensive handgun. semiautomatic A firearm that fires only once for each pull of the trigger. It reloads after each shot. The form: a semiautomatic rifle, a semiautomatic weapon, a semiautomatic pistol . shell The word applies to military or naval ammunition and to shotgun ammunition. For small arms, bullet or round is the common term for ammunition. shot Small lead or steel pellets fired by shotguns. A shotgun shell usually contains 1 to 2 ounces of shot. Do not use shot interchangeably with buckshot , which refers only to the largest shot sizes. shotgun A firearm typically used to fire small spherical pellets called shot. Shotguns usually have a smooth bore barrel, but some contain a rifled barrel, which is used to fire a single projectile. Size is measured according to gauge, except for the .410, which is measured according to caliber, meaning the ball leaving the barrel is 0.41” in diameter. The form: a 12-gauge shotgun, a .410 shotgun . silencer, suppressor A device that muffles the sound of a firearm. They are colloquially known as silencers but are more accurately referred to as suppressors . The device reduces the sound a gun makes when it’s fired but does not eliminate the sound. They generally lower the sound level by 20 to 35 decibels, making most firearms still louder than the average ambulance siren. For clarity, describe the device as a firearm suppressor , and note that it is generally known in generic terms as a silencer . To legally purchase the device, it must be bought from a licensed dealer and the buyer must undergo an extensive background check. The background check, similar to what is required to purchase fully automatic weapons, is tightly regulated under the National Firearms Act of 1934. Each suppressor carries a serial number that can be tracked. Suppressors were invented in the early 1900s by MIT-educated Hiram Percy Maxim, who invented a muffler for gasoline engines. The devices were brought under National Firearms Act regulations after Depression-era game wardens were concerned hunters would use them to poach. submachine gun A lightweight fully automatic gun firing handgun ammunition. first degree, first-degree Hyphenate when used as a compound modifier: It was murder in the first degree. He was convicted of first-degree murder. forcible rape A redundancy that usually should be avoided. It may be used, however, in stories dealing with both rape and statutory rape, which does not necessarily involve the use of force. See sexual abuse, sexual assault, sexual harassment, sexual misconduct . grand jury Always lowercase: a Los Angeles County grand jury, the grand jury . This style has been adopted because, unlike the case with city council and similar governmental units, a jurisdiction frequently has more than one grand jury session. habeas corpus A writ ordering a person in custody to be brought before a court. It places the burden of proof on those detaining the person to justify the detention.\nWhen habeas corpus is used in a story, define it. homicide, murder, manslaughter Homicide is a legal term for killing. Murder is malicious, premeditated homicide. Some states define certain homicides as murder if the killing occurs in the course of armed robbery, rape, etc. Generally speaking, manslaughter is homicide without malice or premeditation. A homicide should not be described as murder unless a person has been convicted of that charge. Do not say that a victim was murdered until someone has been convicted in court. Instead, say that a victim was killed, stabbed to death , etc. Use caution in the phrasing charged with murdering ; not everyone charged with murder is accused of the act of shooting, stabbing, etc. An alternative, in such cases, is charged in the murder of … See execute, execution and assassin, killer, murderer . indict Use indict only in connection with the legal process of bringing charges against an individual or corporation. To avoid any suggestion that someone is being judged before a trial, do not use phrases such as indicted for killing or indicted for bribery . Instead, use indicted on a charge of killing or indicted on a bribery charge . For guidelines on related words, see accused, alleged, suspected ; allege ; and arrest . innocent, not guilty In court cases, plea situations and trials, not guilty is preferable to innocent , because it is more precise legally. (However, take special care to prevent omission of the word not .) When possible, say a defendant was acquitted of criminal charges. jail Not interchangeable with prison . See prison, jail . jury The word takes singular verbs and pronouns: The jury has been sequestered until it reaches a verdict . Include racial and gender breakdown only if relevant. Do not capitalize: a U.S. District Court jury, a federal jury, a Massachusetts Superior Court jury, a Los Angeles County grand jury . See grand jury . juvenile, minor Juvenile and minor are broad terms that can carry legal connotations when sometimes there are none, or those connotations are beside the point. The terms' clinical tone can inadvertently suggest guilt in situations of crime or conflict. They can be dehumanizing. They can be perceived as having racial connotations. Their definitions can vary across jurisdictions. Depending on the context and available information, consider terms like child, teenagers, youths, young teens , etc. Use specific ages or age ranges when possible: 5-year-old girls , not young girls or 15- to 20-year-olds , not youths . Or consider descriptions such as children and young teens (if accurate). When possible, ask sources who use the terms juvenile or minor for specifics on what they mean, then use those specifics rather than the general terms. Police said they were searching for a male believed to be in his teens , rather than police said they were searching for a male juvenile . Or: Searchers rescued 71 migrants — 22 of them believed to be under age 18 — rather than 22 of them minors . Or: The bill would make it illegal for an adult to help someone under age 18 get an abortion without parental consent , rather than help a minor get an abortion . If specifics are not available, don't guess at what is meant. In those cases, the terms juvenile or minor are acceptable, but limit their use. The term juvenile is more often used in criminal contexts, while the term minor has more general uses and connotations. Apply judgment and terminology evenly across racial and cultural groups. For example, don't use a 15-year-old to describe a white victim or suspect but a minor, a juvenile, a youth , etc., to describe a 15-year-old victim or suspect of color. Consider legal and other social nuances when choosing words to describe young people. Discuss with colleagues of varying backgrounds and heritages. In some states, laws prohibit publishing or broadcasting the names of people suspected or convicted of a crime if they are under a certain age. Follow the local law unless there is a compelling reason to the contrary. Consult with managers — the Standards team or Nerve Center for AP staff — if you believe such an exception is warranted. See boy, girl ; youth ; ages ; privacy . looting, looters The taking or carrying off of plunder, or to burglarize or steal, during a riot, civil unrest or natural disaster. Apply the word looters carefully and specifically to those who engage in looting, do not overuse, and avoid the labeling and the stigmatizing of larger communities, groups or all protesters. The word looters applied to large groups has carried racial overtones in the past. Whenever possible, explain circumstances. For example, A group of people at the protest broke into the store and took whatever was on the shelves . People engaged in looting may be petty criminals, individual community members or criminal gangs who have no relation to any nearby protests. In severe emergencies, such as hurricanes and floods that disrupt supplies, people sometimes steal to obtain water, food, medicine or essentials to survive. In all cases, it is important to explain the actions and the context in detail. Mace A trademark, shortened from Chemical Mace , for a brand of tear gas that is packaged in an aerosol canister and temporarily stuns its victims. nolo contendere The literal meaning is, \"I do not wish to contend.\" Terms such as pleaded no contest or a no-contest plea are acceptable in all references. When defendants in a criminal case enter this plea, it means that they are not admitting guilt but is stating that they will offer no defense. The person is then subject to being judged guilty and punished as if there had been a guilty plea or a conviction. The principal difference is that the defendant retains the option of denying the same charge in another legal proceeding. officer-involved, police-involved Avoid this vague jargon for shootings and other cases involving police. Be specific about what happened. If police use the term, ask for detail. How was the officer or officers involved? Who did the shooting? If the information is not available or not provided, spell that out. pardon, parole, probation The terms often are confused, but each has a specific meaning. Do not use them interchangeably. A pardon forgives and releases a person from further punishment. It is granted by a chief of state or a governor. By itself, it does not expunge a record of conviction, if one exists, and it does not by itself restore civil rights. A general pardon , usually for political offenses, is called amnesty . Parole is the release of a person in prison before the sentence has expired, on condition of good behavior. It is granted by a parole board, part of the executive branch of government, and can be revoked only by the board. Probation is the suspension of sentence for a person convicted, but not yet imprisoned, on condition of good behavior. It is imposed and revoked only by a judge. pedophilia Sexual desire felt by an adult for children. Do not use in a legal sense such as a pedophilia conviction or convicted pedophile . Instead, refer to the charges. For example, convicted of child sexual abuse; conviction on charges of sexually abusing children . prison, jail, prisoner, inmate, incarcerated person Do not use prison and jail or prisoner and inmate interchangeably. Prison is a generic term for facilities that usually confine people serving incarceration sentences of more than a year. They typically are run by states or the federal government, or by private companies. The term may be used for federal facilities often known as penitentiaries and for what are sometimes called correctional institutions , as well as for state prisons . A jail is normally used to confine people serving sentences for lesser crimes and for less than a year; people awaiting trial or sentencing on either felony or misdemeanor charges; and people confined for civil matters such as failure to pay alimony. Jails usually are run by local authorities such as a city or county. Capitalize the full proper name of a prison, jail, penitentiary, etc. Lowercase uses such as the county jail, the state prison . Use lowercase for all plural constructions: the Colorado and Kansas state penitentiaries . See https://bop.gov for more detail on federal facilities. Do not use the term prisoner for someone confined in a jail. An inmate can be in either a prison or a jail. When possible, use person-first language to describe someone who is incarcerated : A man who is incarcerated in an Alabama prison is appealing his sentence instead of A state prison inmate is appealing his sentence . The state is planning more education programs for people in prison . A man facing execution instead of a death-row inmate . Do not use felon , convict or ex-con as nouns. privacy Special care should be taken with regard to publishing the names of people under age 18 involved or suspected in crimes, or of people who may have been the victims of sexual assault or other abuse. Generally, we do not identify people under 18 who are accused of crimes, or transmit images that would reveal their identity. However, managers may authorize exceptions. Considerations in granting exceptions may include the severity of the crime or alleged crime; whether police have formally released the suspect's name; and whether the person has been formally charged as an adult. Other considerations might include public safety, such as when the youth is the subject of a search; or widespread publication of the suspect's name, making the identity de facto public knowledge. In some situations, state or national laws may determine whether the person's name can be published. We normally do not identify, in text or through images, people under 18 who are witnesses to crimes. We also do not identify, in text or through images, people who may have been sexually assaulted (unless they have come forward and voluntarily identified themselves). We should also use discretion in naming victims of other extremely severe abuse. Sometimes a person may be identified by AP in an abduction or search situation, and it develops later that — because of a sexual assault or other reason — the name should not be used. In such cases we have sometimes refrained from using the identification in future coverage. We do not name suspects or transmit images of them in brief stories about minor crimes when there is little chance AP will cover the case beyond the initial arrest. We also do not link to local stories about such incidents where the arrested person's name or mug shot might be used. The policy does not apply to serious charges or crimes, such as those involving violence or abuse of the public trust, or cases of a fugitive on the run. See juvenile, minor ; sexual abuse, sexual assault, sexual harassment, sexual misconduct . prosecutor Capitalize before a name when it is the formal title. In most cases, however, the formal title is a term such as attorney general, state's attorney or U.S. attorney . If so, use the formal title on first reference. Lowercase prosecutor if used before a name on a subsequent reference, generally to help the reader distinguish between prosecutor and defense attorney without having to look back to the start of the story. See titles . prostitute Avoid terms like child, underage or teenage prostitute , except in quotations or in referring to criminal charges that may use these terms. The phrasing can suggest that a child is voluntarily trading sex for money. Minors are not able to consent. (The age of consent varies by jurisdiction; know the law of the state or jurisdiction in question.) See sex work, prostitution . riot, unrest, protest, demonstration, uprising, revolt Use care in deciding which term best applies: A riot is a wild or violent disturbance of the peace involving a group of people. The term riot suggests uncontrolled chaos and pandemonium. Focusing on rioting and property destruction rather than underlying grievance has been used in the past to stigmatize broad swaths of people protesting against lynching or police brutality or for racial justice, going back at least to the urban uprisings of the 1960s in the U.S. Inciting to riot is a longstanding criminal offense involving two or more people. In the United States, a federal criminal anti-riot act was enacted in 1968 in response to violent civil disturbances and protests of that era. Unrest is a vaguer, milder and less emotional term for a condition of angry discontent and protest verging on revolt. Protest and demonstration refer to specific actions such as marches, sit-ins, rallies or other actions meant to register dissent. They can be legal or illegal, organized or spontaneous, peaceful or violent, and involve any number of people. Revolt and uprising both suggest a broader political dimension or civil upheavals, a sustained period of protests, or unrest against powerful groups or governing systems. sexual abuse, sexual assault, sexual harassment, sexual misconduct Proceed with care when using these terms, along with others such as rape, molestation, unwanted sex, sexual relationship , etc. Authorities, people making accusations and people who stand accused use a variety of language and terminology to cover a wide spectrum of actions or behavior. Interpretations can vary widely. Do not simply repeat those terms. Instead, pay close attention to legal definitions, which vary by jurisdiction, and the wording of criminal charges or convictions. Consider the nuance of each situation and what may be conveyed or perceived by the language used. As with all accusations, allegations should be well documented and corroborated. Always seek comment from accused individuals or their representatives. We generally do not identify, in text or images, those who say they have been sexually assaulted or subjected to extreme abuse. We may identify victims of sexual assault or extreme abuse when victims publicly identify themselves. Decisions on identifying people who say they have been subject to other forms of sexual misconduct should be made on a case-by-case basis, depending on the nature of the allegations. Among points to consider: Terms such as rape, sexual assault and sexual harassment have legal definitions that vary by jurisdiction. Knowing the definitions is essential when deciding which term(s) are accurate and appropriate. Depending on state law, rape and sexual assault can include sexual contact by force, threat or coercion, or after the accuser's incapacitation due to drugs or alcohol. When reporting on court cases, use the language contained in the charges and/or conviction. If a defendant is charged with sexual assault , do not say he is charged with rape . If a defendant is convicted on a charge of sexual misconduct , do not say he was convicted of having unwanted sex with the victim or convicted of rape . If someone is charged with sexual harassment , do not say they are accused of sexual assault . It may be appropriate to explain why a story does or does not use certain terms: The woman said she was raped; prosecutors charged the man with sexual assault under the definitions in state law. Another example: He was convicted of taking indecent liberties, which is the formal criminal charge . The term sexual relationship implies consent. Under state laws, a minor cannot give sexual consent to an adult. Thus, do not write that an adult had a sexual relationship with or had sex with a minor or vice versa. (The age of consent varies by jurisdiction; know the law of the state or jurisdiction in question.) In other cases, consider carefully whether relationship is an appropriate term. A key issue in many cases is the element of consent, and definitions of what constitutes consent vary. Refer to the laws of the jurisdiction in question. The terms sexual harassment and sexual misconduct generally denote behavior that does not include rape, sexual assault, sexual abuse or sexual violence . Sexual misconduct is preferred over sexual harassment , as it encompasses a broader range of misbehavior and does not run the risk of diminishing an alleged act. Use sexual harassment when reporting on a specific legal charge or formal Equal Employment Opportunity Commission complaint. The term sexual violence may occasionally be used in broad references to sexual assault, rape and sexual abuse . Use the more specific wording for individual cases. After using a broad term such as sexual misconduct or sexual assault , describe generally the kinds of behavior alleged or admitted to — such as groping, unwanted kissing, disrobing, verbal abuse, digital penetration, oral sex, etc. Provide enough detail to make clear the alleged crimes, while avoiding a level of detail that could be perceived as gratuitous. Do not refer to a person making an accusation as a victim unless the accused person has been convicted. Avoid the term alleged victim . The term accuser is acceptable, especially when referring to a group of people: Bill Cosby's accusers . Limit its use when referring to an individual in favor of the correct pronoun. The woman said the defendant forcibly kissed her . RESOURCES : https://www.eeoc.gov/harassment https://apps.rainn.org/policy/ See anonymous sources ; privacy . sex work, prostitution Sex work and sex worker are acceptable as umbrella terms for prostitution, prostitute and other words describing the exchange of sexual services for goods or money — legal or not. Use more specific terms like prostitute, dancer, stripper, porn performer, online performer , etc., if needed for clarity or if the subjects describe themselves as such. Also use more specific descriptions of a situation, such as trafficking , if needed. Use prostitute and prostitution if those are the terms used in quotations, criminal charges, legislation, etc. Supporters of the term sex work argue that the phrasing provides dignity to people using the means available to them for survival and lessens the shame associated with a universally acknowledged but long-stigmatized line of work. Detractors of the terminology note that activities described as sex work — particularly prostitution — can involve coercion, exploitation, trafficking or slavery, and that minors are unable to legally consent to such \"work.\" Avoid terms like child prostitute or underage sex worker that can suggest a child is voluntarily trading sex for money. Though some underage people seek out sex work for financial support, they are in most cases not legally able to consent to sex. Instead, use specific phrasing that conveys context and relevance. Avoid escort as a synonym for prostitute . Escorts are often paid for their time or companionship instead of or in addition to sexual services. See human smuggling/people smuggling, human trafficking/people trafficking . slay, slaying, slain Avoid this journalese. Use kill, killing or killed instead. See homicide, murder, manslaughter ; and cliches, jargon . survivor, victim Use these terms with care because they can be imprecise and politically and legally fraught. Survivor can denote someone who has lived through an injury or disease, but also can apply to someone who endured a threat but escaped injury altogether. Example: a mass shooting survivor . Likewise, victim can create confusion because it can variously mean someone killed, injured or subjected to mistreatment such as sexual misconduct. Be specific if there is room for confusion: The ceremony honored people wounded in the mass shooting , not The ceremony honored victims and/or survivors of the mass shooting . The play told the story of those killed in the hurricane , not The play told the stories of the hurricane's victims . Also be alert to potential biases and assumptions inherent in the word victim . A phrase such as AIDS victim , for instance, not only makes it unclear whether the subject is alive or dead, but many AIDS patients do not consider themselves victims. Instead, use neutral, precise descriptions: He has AIDS. She has hepatitis . In crime stories, avoid alleged victim if possible; it is too easily construed as skepticism. In stories in which sexual misconduct or other allegations are leveled, consider calling the person making the allegations an accuser instead of a victim if shorthand is needed, to avoid implications of guilt on the part of the accused. Survivor is often used to describe people who have lived through physical or emotional trauma, as in abuse or rape survivor . It is best to be specific when referring to individuals, especially if the person was never in danger of death. Use of survivor gets more latitude when describing groups. A group of Holocaust survivors met at the memorial . See diseases ; homicide, murder, manslaughter ; allege ; sexual abuse, sexual assault, sexual harassment, sexual misconduct . suspect The word refers to a person who police, prosecutors or other authorities believe or say committed a crime. Do not use it to mean a person of unknown identity who definitely committed a crime. In other words, don't substitute suspect for robber, killer, rapist , etc., in describing an event, even if authorities phrase it that way. Correct: Police said the robber stole 14 diamond rings; the thief ran away . Incorrect: Police said the suspect stole 14 diamond rings; the suspect ran away . Conversely, don't substitute robber, killer, rapist , etc., when suspect is indeed the correct word. Correct: Police arrested the suspect the next day . Incorrect: Police arrested the robber the next day . Also see separate allege and accused, alleged, suspected entries. For guidance on related terms, see arrest and indict. Taser Taser is the trademark name for the energy weapon manufactured by Axon and used by the vast majority of law enforcement agencies in the United States. In the U.S., use the term Taser instead of stun gun ; the two are not the same. Stun guns use electricity to inflict sharp, localized pain on contact. A Taser shoots probes that transmit electricity, causing a person's muscles to flex in what is known as neuromuscular incapacitation and temporarily immobilizing the person. Some older-model Taser weapons have a feature, known as drive-stun , which can be used to inflict localized pain like a stun gun. But most police in the U.S. use Tasers by shooting prongs. Tasers also are used by many but not all law enforcement agencies outside the U.S. In those jurisdictions, try to determine the type of weapon involved. Don't use verbs like tasered or tased . Instead, refer to someone being shocked with a Taser . When verb forms appear in direct quotations, use lowercase. terrorism The calculated use of violence, especially against civilians, to create terror to disrupt and demoralize societies for political ends. Israel, the U.S., the European Union and some other Western countries have branded Hamas and Hezbollah as terrorist groups. However, the terms terrorism and terrorist have become politicized, and often are applied inconsistently around the world. Because they can be used to label such a wide range of actions and events, and because the debate around them is so intense, detailing what happened is more precise and better serves audiences. Instead of labeling an attack or attacker as terrorism or terrorist , AP describes the specific atrocity, massacre, bombing, or assassination, and so on. We do not use the terms terrorism or terrorist for specific actions or groups, other than when attributed to authorities or others. We continue to use the terms in broad references to terrorism as a threat and anti-terrorism efforts, fear of terror , etc. trusty An incarcerated person considered trustworthy and allowed special privileges. youth, youths Applicable from age 13 until 18th birthday. Use man or woman for people 18 and older. See juvenile, minor ; boy, girl ."}

{"source_url": "https://www.apstylebook.com/ap_stylebook/criminal-justice/", "entry_header": "Criminal Justice", "text_content": "We cover public safety to provide accurate and fair reporting about communities, to educate people about trends that drive public policy changes, and to hold accountable law enforcement and others in positions of power. We also cover the criminal justice system to shine a light on the lives of victims of violence and reveal problems and injustices. This journalism requires precise language and care in reporting. Our reporting methods and approach, as well as our visuals and words, should always be thoughtful. Criminal justice reporting and writing also requires a commitment to fairness by always giving a person accused of a crime the opportunity to comment, following up on crime stories throughout the justice system, and highlighting instances in which a person’s name has been cleared. It requires cultivating a diversity of sources and always working to verify information provided by law enforcement or other authorities. And often it calls for accountability journalism: looking for warning signs that might have been missed; law enforcement response; weapon issues; what might be done to prevent similar crimes in the future. FAIRNESS A fundamental principle of the criminal justice system is that all people accused of crimes are presumed to be innocent until they have been proven guilty in court. That principle should also be central to newsrooms’ coverage of crime and courts, in line with key journalistic principles of balance and accuracy. When considering whether to write about an arrest or criminal charges, ask yourself: Will I follow this case until the end? If not, you may not know if the charges are later dropped or if the suspect was acquitted. If it is a minor crime and you are unlikely to follow up with coverage about the outcome of the case, consider not naming the suspect in the story or not writing about the case at all. It also is essential when writing about someone charged with a crime to get a response from the accused person, their attorney, a family member or another representative. If sufficient efforts are made to speak to a representative for the defendant and no one is available or they decline to comment, we must highlight in stories the efforts taken to reflect the point of view of the person who is accused. This must be done even when covering a defendant’s guilty plea or conviction. It is not about checking a box but about upholding our commitment to fairness. In breaking news situations, a story can be published without a suspect’s name if there is not enough time to make sufficient efforts to reach someone to comment on their behalf. Unless the suspect is a prominent person, their name may not be the highest-value news in a story. It can be added later once we have tried to reach a lawyer, family member or another representative who can speak on their behalf. Be aware of your own unconscious biases, particularly when framing angles and approaches that may inadvertently vary depending on the race, gender and other characteristics of both the suspect and the victims. For example: calling an 18-year-old white suspect a teen and an 18-year-old Black suspect a man. (Best to use just the age in both cases.) INITIAL REPORTS; SOURCE DEVELOPMENT; DEEPER CONTEXT Be cautious about initial news releases or statements from law enforcement or other officials. Accounts by police, especially in the hours just after a crime, are very incomplete and can be inaccurate, whether about specific details or about motivations behind the crime. Press for details and substantiation: How do they know? If key details aren’t known or can’t be confirmed, say so in the story. Attribute carefully and thoroughly. If descriptions change, say so. For example: The police chief initially said the shooting was not a hate crime, without explaining that conclusion, but later said she believes the victim’s race was the motivation. She said the suspect had posted racist rants on social media. Also remember that police may release information before officials review  footage from body cameras, dashboard cameras, surveillance cameras or bystanders’ cameras. What they see later in that footage may change the story. That’s why it is crucial to always work to verify and corroborate official accounts by talking to witnesses, victims, relatives and other sources. Use verified or vetted user-generated content to give you eyes and ears on the ground if you can’t be at the scene. Look for livestreamed videos and call nearby homes and businesses to find additional details for your coverage. (AP staff should consult with Standards editors and the Nerve Center before publishing any livestreamed video or content created by the suspect. See below on dealing with graphic material.) Local or state governmental representatives like mayors or school board members are often briefed on situations and can help provide information that can keep the public safe or provide insight into investigations. Trauma care doctors and centers can provide context about the response to mass violence and other traumatic events in the weeks after the initial emergency. And agencies like the Red Cross can often help describe the scope of events through the needs they are seeing and the response they are organizing. Victim advocacy groups, anti-violence advocates and social justice advocates can also be important sources. Neighborhood groups or businesses can add needed context or nuance in stories about police violence. Reaching witnesses on social media or contacting family representatives or civil rights attorneys can shed light on gaps in information that comes from law enforcement sources. Other law enforcement agencies aiding in an investigation can be helpful sources. In stories about mass shootings or high-profile prisoner escapes, for example, other assisting law enforcement organizations include federal agencies like the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives or the U.S. Marshals Service, neighboring police departments, or state police. These agencies and departments can help vet information, add deeper context with their expertise or help us gain a deeper understanding of events. They may know the kinds of weapons recovered or used, or the response times. They could help dispel misinformation that develops sometimes on social media regarding large events. It is crucial to stay in touch with sources when news is not breaking. If law enforcement, anti-violence advocates or other sources hear from a journalist only after a crime, they may feel exploited or see the relationship as merely transactional. In many circumstances, we report more accurately on criminal justice issues when community sources see us as reliable, caring and trustworthy. INTERVIEWING VICTIMS AND FAMILY MEMBERS We want to include the voices of victims, survivors and their family members. But we want to be sensitive in our questions and approach. See these tips from the Dart Center for Journalism and Trauma: https://dartcenter.org/resources/tips-interviewing-victims-tragedy-witnesses-and-survivors MUG SHOTS We do not publish mug shots simply because of the appearance of the person who is accused, nor do we cover a story driven by a particularly embarrassing mug shot. Many viewers and readers associate mug shots with guilt — even if the person has not been convicted or even gone to trial yet. Because of that, mug shots should not be the lead image or only photo linked to a story in most cases or appear as the lead visual or thumbnail on consumer-facing video. In the AP, exceptions may be made in consultation with the Standards team or Nerve Center. Generally do not use the suspect’s mug shot, or any photo of the suspect, as the first photo in a sequence or gallery, or prominently in a video. But consider the nature of a given story. If the suspect is at large and being sought, that could change the decision. If the trial is beginning or ending, that also could be a factor. If in doubt, AP staff should consult with the Nerve Center or the Standards team. After a person has been convicted, the mug shot or other photo of the person may be used as the first photo in a gallery when appropriate to the nature of the story. But again, consider the type of story, especially those about a victim’s life, the victim’s family, survivors and other angles. Also see the next section on dealing with graphic material. GRAPHIC MATERIAL Consider: What public good is served by including graphic details or images of violence, abuse or death? Does each detail advance the story or people’s understanding of what happened; or does it serve just to shock and push people away without accomplishing anything? The answers can vary depending on the specific detail or image, or the specific story. Are those details necessary to understand the story? Or are they outweighed by potential harm to survivors, families, communities? We want to accurately depict and explain what happened. But that doesn’t necessarily mean including every detail or image that we have. Also consider the impact to the journalists who view graphic images or videos. Aim to limit the number of people who may see them. This may mean a small email group or other limited sharing. Warn colleagues of graphic content — including visuals and words — when sharing a link or photo in a company messaging app like Slack or Microsoft Teams. Newsroom leaders are encouraged to offer mental health resources and other support for journalists who view such images, and allow them to opt out. In the AP, if you are asked to deal with such images, you can decline. Think about your own mental health before handling, or seeking out, brutal imagery. The same goes for any scenario in covering these events, including talking with relatives or members of the community. LANGUAGE Consider the difference between details that give meaning and context to a story vs. details or word choices that may be “colorful” but also gratuitous or even offensive. Avoid language that carries a negative connotation or stereotype, like describing a neighborhood as gritty . Decide if such descriptions are relevant, and why. If used, give specifics rather than general labels that may be just stereotypes. As the Stylebook’s race-related coverage guidance notes: “Be aware that some words and phrases that seem innocuous to one group can carry negative connotations, even be seen as slurs, to another. As with all news coverage, be sensitive to your varied audiences and their different perceptions of language and the larger world.” For instance, if a homeless person is accused of a crime, mention their city of residence, if available, the same way you would for anyone else: Roberts, of Los Angeles, was charged , not Roberts, who has no permanent address, was charged . And not: A homeless man was charged … Write that the man was arrested a block from his home , not the man was arrested a block from his mobile home . Be aware that many people see thug as code for a racial slur; Black boy has a loaded history and should be avoided in referring to Black males of any age; unarmed Black man could be seen as assuming the default is for Black men to be armed. Do not write in a way that assumes white is default. Not: The officer is accused of choking Owens, who is Black . Instead: The white officer is accused of choking Owens, who is Black . Use caution when describing a certain person as a killer, murderer, thief , etc., even after a conviction. A conviction may be overturned, the person may be otherwise exonerated, the person may have been wrongfully convicted, etc. Another option is to use person-first language: Joe Smith, who was convicted of killing Jane Smith, is appealing his sentence , instead of convicted killer Joe Smith is appealing his sentence . THE TERMS SHOOTER, KILLER, GUNMAN General references to the shooter, the killer, the gunman , etc., are acceptable: The police chief said the shooter fired 15 rounds. But in most cases, don’t write the shooter in reference to the specific person, or use wording such as Smith fired 15 shots in killing his wife and son , unless the shooter also died or has been convicted. For example, if the person is alive and not convicted, do not write: The police chief said the shooter worked at XYZ for six months until he was fired a week ago . Instead, use the term suspect in such a case. Avoid the term alleged shooter . There can be exceptions, notably if the shooter livestreamed the attacks, or posted extensively about their involvement, or in other ways left no question about their identity. In the AP, discuss such exceptions with the Standards team and Nerve Center. See the next section with cautions on the use of such material. The term gunman is acceptable, if the person is or was male and an adult. However, in the early stages of an investigation, information about the person’s gender may be incorrect. So use caution with this term. SUSPECT’S WRITINGS, LIVESTREAMS Limit use of the perpetrator’s writings (don’t call them manifestos) and social media postings. Summarize rather than quote directly unless the quotation itself is clearly relevant. Generally avoid use of the person’s livestreaming; in the AP, discuss with Standards editors and the Nerve Center. CRIME DATA Avoid repeating claims or rhetoric about crime rates or trends and instead, turn to data as needed for a story. Journalists should also consider other data sources and points of view not necessarily captured by crime data — which is often incomplete, especially at the national level — and cultivate community sources to reflect other relevant context for crime trends. TRANSGENDER PEOPLE Use the gender, pronouns and name a transgender person goes by or went by in public life, which is not always the same as those on legal or medical documents. Use a transgender person’s previous name or pretransition image only if required to understand the news or if requested by the person. Use of previous names is often called deadnaming and can be insensitive, offensive and traumatizing. When covering transgender people, including in stories about crimes or accidents that resulted in the person’s death, be cognizant that authorities or family members may be ignorant of or be disregarding the person’s wishes about their name or pronouns. When possible, take into account information given by the person or by friends or others who may have better knowledge about how the person lived and identified. In the AP, use of a transgender person’s previous name must be approved by the Standards team or Nerve Center. See gender, sex and sexual orientation .

To avoid any suggestion that a person is being judged before a trial, do not use a phrase such as alleged killer Ralph Hornsby ; the alleged killer ; suspected shooter Carmine Jablonski ; the suspected shooter , etc. Instead: Ralph Hornsby, charged with killing the man. Alford plea A plea in which a defendant pleads guilty to a charge but maintains their innocence. Explain the term if used in a story. allege The word must be used with great care. Some guidelines: Avoid any suggestion that the writer is making an allegation. Specify the source of an allegation. In a criminal case, it should be an arrest record, an indictment or the statement of a public official connected with the case. Use alleged bribe or similar phrase when necessary to make it clear that an unproved action is not being treated as fact. Be sure that the source of the charge is specified elsewhere in the story. Avoid, where possible, alleged victim . It is too easily construed as skepticism of a victim’s account. Avoid redundant uses of alleged . It is proper to say: The district attorney alleged that she took a bribe . Or: The district attorney accused her of taking a bribe . But not: The district attorney accused her of allegedly taking a bribe . Do not use alleged to describe an event that is known to have occurred, when the dispute is over who participated in it. Do not say: He attended the alleged meeting when what you mean is: He allegedly attended the meeting . Do not use alleged as a routine qualifier. Instead, use a word such as apparent , ostensible or reputed . For guidelines on related words, see accused, alleged, suspected ; arrest ; and indict . arrest To avoid any suggestion that someone is being judged before a trial, do not use a phrase such as arrested for killing . Instead, use arrested on a charge of killing . If a charge hasn’t been filed, arrested on suspicion of , or a similar phrase, should be used. For guidelines on related words, see accused, alleged, suspected ; allege ; indict ; sue . assassin, killer, murderer An assassin is one who kills a prominent person for political reasons, material gain or devotion to a cause. A killer is anyone who kills with a motive of any kind. A murderer is one who is convicted of murder in a court of law. Do not use these terms for specific suspects until they have been convicted or pleaded guilty — and use caution when describing a certain person as a killer, murderer or assassin even after a conviction. A conviction may be overturned, the person may be otherwise exonerated, the person may have been wrongfully convicted, etc. Another option is to use person-first language: Joe Smith, who was convicted of killing Jane Smith, is appealing his sentence , instead of convicted killer Joe Smith is appealing his sentence . Do not use phrasing such as accused murderer or accused killer . See homicide, murder, manslaughter . assault, battery Assault almost always implies physical contact and sudden, intense violence. Legally, however, assault means simply to threaten violence, as in pointing a pistol at an individual without firing it. Assault and battery is the legal term when the victim was touched by the assaulter or something the assaulter put in motion. bail Bail is money or property that will be forfeited to the court if an accused individual fails to appear for trial. It may be posted as follows: The person may deposit with the court the full amount or its equivalent in collateral such as a deed to property. A friend or relative may make such a deposit with the court. The accused person may pay a professional bail bondsman a percentage of the total figure. The bondsman, in turn, guarantees the court that it will receive from him the full amount in the event the individual fails to appear for trial. It is correct in all cases to say that an accused person posted bail or posted a bail bond (the money held by the court is a form of bond). When a distinction is desired, say that the individual posted his own bail , that bail was posted by a friend or relative , or that bail was obtained through a bondsman . body camera Preferred for cameras mounted on clothing, generally of law enforcers. When the condensed version appears in headlines or in quotes, it is bodycam , one word. burglary, larceny, robbery, theft Legal definitions of burglary vary, but in general a burglary involves entering a building (not necessarily by breaking in) and remaining unlawfully with the intention of committing a crime. Larceny is the legal term for the wrongful taking of property. Its nonlegal equivalents are stealing or theft . Robbery in the legal sense involves the use of violence or threat in committing larceny. In a wider sense it means to plunder or rifle , and may thus be used even if a person was not present: His house was robbed while he was away . Theft describes a larceny that did not involve threat, violence or plundering. USAGE NOTE: You rob a person, bank, house, etc., but you steal the money or the jewels. casualties Avoid using the word, which is vague and can refer to either injuries or deaths. Instead, be specific about what is meant. If authorities use the term, press for specifics. If specifics aren’t available, say so: Officer Riya Kumar said the shooting resulted in casualties, but she said she did not know whether any were deaths. child pornography Generally avoid the terms child pornography and child porn . Use them only when essential in direct quotations or excerpts from documents. Instead, describe such charges or allegations as possessing (or producing ) child sexual abuse images or possessing (or producing ) child sexual abuse material , including in headlines. See child sexual abuse images for more guidance. child sexual abuse images The preferred term, instead of child pornography or child porn , for sexually explicit visual content depicting someone under age 18. While the term child pornography appears in many state and federal laws, that phrasing should be avoided in news stories because it can diminish the seriousness of the crime and its impact on victims. Many advocacy groups and law enforcement agencies, including the U.S. Department of Justice, now prefer the term child sexual abuse material . Use material if some of the content is nonvisual or if the exact nature isn’t known. Do not refer to it in headlines or stories as CSAM , the acronym that is sometimes used. When possible, be precise about the case that is being described, with language such as photos depicting the sexual abuse of children, videos depicting the sexual exploitation of children or sexually explicit photos and videos of children . But avoid graphic descriptions of the images or other material. See child pornography . civil cases, criminal cases A civil case is one in which an individual, business or agency of government seeks damages or relief from another individual, business or agency of government. Civil actions generally involve a charge that a contract has been breached or that someone has been wronged or injured. A criminal case is one that the state or the federal government brings against an individual charged with committing a crime. commutation A legal term for a change of sentence or punishment to one that is less severe. See pardon, parole, probation . convict (v.) Follow with preposition of , not for : He was convicted of murder . Do not use convict or ex-con as a noun. See prison, jail, prisoner, inmate, people who are incarcerated . cop Be careful in the use of this colloquial term for police officer . It may be used in lighter stories and in casual, informal descriptions, but often is a derogatory term out of place in serious police stories. courthouse Capitalize with the name of a jurisdiction: the Cook County Courthouse, the U.S. Courthouse . Lowercase in other uses: the county courthouse, the courthouse, the federal courthouse . Court House (two words) is used in the proper names of some communities: Appomattox Court House, Virginia . cyberattack See the Technology chapter. defund To stop providing or to reduce funds, especially government funds, for a program, group, etc. The term defund the police often refers to taking funds from police departments to spend on other priorities such as employment programs, mental health services and social services to increase public safety. The term is sometimes misrepresented as abolishing police. Avoid using the term other than in a direct quotation; if used in a quotation, explain and provide detail about what is being sought. detective Do not abbreviate. Capitalize before a name only if it is a formal rank: police Detective Frank Serpico, private detective Richard Diamond . See titles . district attorney Capitalize when used as a formal title before a name: District Attorney Hamilton Burger . DA acceptable on second reference. See titles . drive-by (adj.) A drive-by shooting. DUI, DWI Abbreviations for driving under the influence or driving while intoxicated . Acceptable in all references. See drunk, drunken, drunkeness . execute, execution To execute a person is to kill that person in compliance with a military order or judicial decision. See assassin, killer, murderer and homicide, murder, manslaughter . execution-style Avoid use of this term to describe how people are killed, since it means different things to different people. Be specific as to how the person was killed, if that information is necessary. felony, misdemeanor A felony is a serious crime. A misdemeanor is a minor offense against the law. A fuller definition of what constitutes a felony or misdemeanor depends on the governmental jurisdiction involved. At the federal level, a misdemeanor is a crime that carries a potential penalty of no more than a year in jail. A felony is a crime that carries a potential penalty of more than a year in prison. Often, however, a statute gives a judge options such as imposing a fine or probation in addition to or instead of a jail or prison sentence. See prison, jail, prisoner, inmate, people who are incarcerated . firearms, guns, assault weapons Assault weapon is a political term that is often used by state and federal lawmakers to refer to types of semiautomatic rifles with certain features. States with assault weapons bans have varying definitions, but they generally refer to semiautomatic firearms with features such as a detachable magazine, pistol grip, a folding or detachable stock, or a threaded barrel. The terms assault weapons or assault rifles may be used in headlines and in first reference in a story because that is how the group of firearms has become commonly known. But high in the story, give specifics. For example: certain semiautomatic rifles referred to as assault weapons , or certain semiautomatic rifles commonly called assault weapons . Be as specific as possible about the types of guns at issue in any given law or story. Use the terms AR- or AK-style rifles when accurate. AR stands for Armalite Rifle , a nod to the company that designed the first one. AR-style rifles , the most common being the AR-15 style, are now made by numerous companies. AK-style is a different type of rifle based on the design of Mikhail Kalashnikova, the original creator of the AK-47 . Do not refer to assault weapons bans as bans on semiautomatic weapons , which encompasses many modern firearms not classified as assault weapons. Avoid the terms military-style rifles or modern sporting rifles . When reporting on guns, do not automatically repeat terms used by authorities, witnesses or others. Witnesses will often misinterpret the sound of a rapidly fired gun or base a description on the look of the weapon. Instead, seek specific and detailed information from authorities, such as a gun’s make, model, caliber and magazine capacity. For example, Authorities said the shooter used a Smith & Wesson M&P15 rifle or Authorities said the man used an AR-style semiautomatic rifle with a 30-round magazine . Use more generalized descriptions, such as rifle or handgun , until such details become available. Under federal law, automatic rifles are restricted in the United States to their manufacturers; licensed dealers; the military; law enforcement; and civilians who have special permission to own such weapons, provided that the weapons were imported or domestically manufactured before May 19, 1986. Other terms: anti-aircraft A cannon or other weapon designed for defense against air attack. The form: a 105 mm anti-aircraft gun . artillery A carriage-mounted cannon. automatic A firearm that reloads automatically after each shot. The term should not be used to describe the rate of fire. To avoid confusion, specify fully automatic or semiautomatic rather than simply automatic. Give the type of weapon or model for clarity. bolt-action rifle A manually operated handle on the barrel opens and closes the breech, ejecting a spent round, loading another and cocking the weapon for triggering. Popular for hunting and target-shooting. Example: Remington 700 . Some shotguns are bolt-action. buckshot See shot . bullet The projectile fired by a rifle, pistol or machine gun. Together with metal casing, primer and propellant, it forms a cartridge . caliber A measurement of the diameter of the inside of a gun barrel except for most shotguns. Measurement is in either millimeters or decimal fractions of an inch. The word caliber is not used when giving the metric measurement. The forms: a 9 mm pistol, a .22-caliber rifle . cannon A weapon, usually supported on some type of carriage, that fires explosive projectiles. The form: a 105 mm cannon . Plural is cannons . carbine A short, lightweight rifle, usually having a barrel length of less than 20 inches. The form: an M3 carbine . cartridge See bullet . clip Do not use this term unless in a quote. The correct term is magazine to describe the device used to store multiple rounds of ammunition together as a unit, ready for insertion into a firearm. A clip is a device that stores rounds together that can then be used to load bullets into a magazine . See magazine for a fuller description. Colt Named for Samuel Colt, it designates a make of weapon or ammunition developed for Colt handguns. The forms: a Colt .45-caliber revolver, .45 Colt ammunition . fully automatic A firearm that fires continuously as long as the trigger is depressed. Examples include machine guns and submachine guns . gauge The measure of the size of a shotgun. Gauge is expressed in terms of the number per pound of round lead balls with a diameter equal to the size of the barrel. The bigger the number, the smaller the shotgun. The forms: a 12-gauge shotgun, a .410 shotgun . The .410 actually is a caliber, but commonly is called a gauge. The ball leaving the barrel is 0.41” in diameter. ghost guns Privately made firearms that lack serial numbers used to trace them and are often purchased without a background check. Law enforcement officials have reported ghost guns have increasingly been used in violent crimes across the U.S. Avoid describing them as untraceable guns and instead say they are harder for law enforcement to trace. handgun A pistol or a revolver . howitzer A cannon shorter than a gun of the same caliber employed to fire projectiles at relatively high angles at a target, such as opposing forces behind a ridge. The form: a 105 mm howitzer . lever-action rifle A handle on the stock ejects and loads cartridges and cocks the rifle for triggering. A firearm often associated with the Old West. Example: Winchester 94 . M1, M16 These and similar combinations of a letter and figure(s) designate rifles used by the military. The forms: an M1 rifle, an M16 rifle . machine gun A fully automatic gun that fires as long as the trigger is depressed and bullets are chambered. Such a weapon is generally so large and heavy that it rests on the ground or a mount. A submachine gun is hand-held. The form: a .50-caliber Browning machine gun . magazine The ammunition storage and feeding device within or attached to a firearm. It may be fixed to the firearm or detachable. It is not a clip . Magnum A trademark for a type of high-powered cartridge with a larger case and a larger powder charge than other cartridges of approximately the same caliber. The form: a .357 Magnum, a .44 Magnum . mortar Device used to launch a mortar shell; it is the shell, not the mortar, that is fired. musket A heavy, large-caliber shoulder firearm fired by means of a matchlock, a wheel lock, a flintlock or a percussion lock. Its ammunition is a musket ball. pistol A handgun that can be a single-shot or a semiautomatic. Differs from a revolver in that the chamber and barrel are one integral part. Its size is measured in calibers. The form: a .45-caliber pistol . revolver A handgun. Differs from a pistol in that cartridges are held in chambers in a cylinder that revolves through the barrel. The form: a .45-caliber revolver . rifle A firearm designed or made to be fired from the shoulder and having a rifled bore. It uses bullets or cartridges for ammunition. Its size is measured in calibers. The form: a .22-caliber rifle . Saturday night special A compact, relatively inexpensive handgun. semiautomatic A firearm that fires only once for each pull of the trigger. It reloads after each shot. The form: a semiautomatic rifle, a semiautomatic weapon, a semiautomatic pistol . shell The word applies to military or naval ammunition and to shotgun ammunition. For small arms, bullet or round is the common term for ammunition. shot Small lead or steel pellets fired by shotguns. A shotgun shell usually contains 1 to 2 ounces of shot. Do not use shot interchangeably with buckshot , which refers only to the largest shot sizes. shotgun A firearm typically used to fire small spherical pellets called shot. Shotguns usually have a smooth bore barrel, but some contain a rifled barrel, which is used to fire a single projectile. Size is measured according to gauge, except for the .410, which is measured according to caliber, meaning the ball leaving the barrel is 0.41” in diameter. The form: a 12-gauge shotgun, a .410 shotgun . silencer, suppressor A device that muffles the sound of a firearm. They are colloquially known as silencers but are more accurately referred to as suppressors . The device reduces the sound a gun makes when it’s fired but does not eliminate the sound. They generally lower the sound level by 20 to 35 decibels, making most firearms still louder than the average ambulance siren. For clarity, describe the device as a firearm suppressor , and note that it is generally known in generic terms as a silencer . To legally purchase the device, it must be bought from a licensed dealer and the buyer must undergo an extensive background check. The background check, similar to what is required to purchase fully automatic weapons, is tightly regulated under the National Firearms Act of 1934. Each suppressor carries a serial number that can be tracked. Suppressors were invented in the early 1900s by MIT-educated Hiram Percy Maxim, who invented a muffler for gasoline engines. The devices were brought under National Firearms Act regulations after Depression-era game wardens were concerned hunters would use them to poach. submachine gun A lightweight fully automatic gun firing handgun ammunition. first degree, first-degree Hyphenate when used as a compound modifier: It was murder in the first degree. He was convicted of first-degree murder. forcible rape A redundancy that usually should be avoided. It may be used, however, in stories dealing with both rape and statutory rape, which does not necessarily involve the use of force. See sexual abuse, sexual assault, sexual harassment, sexual misconduct . grand jury Always lowercase: a Los Angeles County grand jury, the grand jury . This style has been adopted because, unlike the case with city council and similar governmental units, a jurisdiction frequently has more than one grand jury session. habeas corpus A writ ordering a person in custody to be brought before a court. It places the burden of proof on those detaining the person to justify the detention.\nWhen habeas corpus is used in a story, define it. homicide, murder, manslaughter Homicide is a legal term for killing. Murder is malicious, premeditated homicide. Some states define certain homicides as murder if the killing occurs in the course of armed robbery, rape, etc. Generally speaking, manslaughter is homicide without malice or premeditation. A homicide should not be described as murder unless a person has been convicted of that charge. Do not say that a victim was murdered until someone has been convicted in court. Instead, say that a victim was killed, stabbed to death , etc. Use caution in the phrasing charged with murdering ; not everyone charged with murder is accused of the act of shooting, stabbing, etc. An alternative, in such cases, is charged in the murder of … See execute, execution and assassin, killer, murderer . indict Use indict only in connection with the legal process of bringing charges against an individual or corporation. To avoid any suggestion that someone is being judged before a trial, do not use phrases such as indicted for killing or indicted for bribery . Instead, use indicted on a charge of killing or indicted on a bribery charge . For guidelines on related words, see accused, alleged, suspected ; allege ; and arrest . innocent, not guilty In court cases, plea situations and trials, not guilty is preferable to innocent , because it is more precise legally. (However, take special care to prevent omission of the word not .) When possible, say a defendant was acquitted of criminal charges. jail Not interchangeable with prison . See prison, jail . jury The word takes singular verbs and pronouns: The jury has been sequestered until it reaches a verdict . Include racial and gender breakdown only if relevant. Do not capitalize: a U.S. District Court jury, a federal jury, a Massachusetts Superior Court jury, a Los Angeles County grand jury . See grand jury . juvenile, minor Juvenile and minor are broad terms that can carry legal connotations when sometimes there are none, or those connotations are beside the point. The terms' clinical tone can inadvertently suggest guilt in situations of crime or conflict. They can be dehumanizing. They can be perceived as having racial connotations. Their definitions can vary across jurisdictions. Depending on the context and available information, consider terms like child, teenagers, youths, young teens , etc. Use specific ages or age ranges when possible: 5-year-old girls , not young girls or 15- to 20-year-olds , not youths . Or consider descriptions such as children and young teens (if accurate). When possible, ask sources who use the terms juvenile or minor for specifics on what they mean, then use those specifics rather than the general terms. Police said they were searching for a male believed to be in his teens , rather than police said they were searching for a male juvenile . Or: Searchers rescued 71 migrants — 22 of them believed to be under age 18 — rather than 22 of them minors . Or: The bill would make it illegal for an adult to help someone under age 18 get an abortion without parental consent , rather than help a minor get an abortion . If specifics are not available, don't guess at what is meant. In those cases, the terms juvenile or minor are acceptable, but limit their use. The term juvenile is more often used in criminal contexts, while the term minor has more general uses and connotations. Apply judgment and terminology evenly across racial and cultural groups. For example, don't use a 15-year-old to describe a white victim or suspect but a minor, a juvenile, a youth , etc., to describe a 15-year-old victim or suspect of color. Consider legal and other social nuances when choosing words to describe young people. Discuss with colleagues of varying backgrounds and heritages. In some states, laws prohibit publishing or broadcasting the names of people suspected or convicted of a crime if they are under a certain age. Follow the local law unless there is a compelling reason to the contrary. Consult with managers — the Standards team or Nerve Center for AP staff — if you believe such an exception is warranted. See boy, girl ; youth ; ages ; privacy . looting, looters The taking or carrying off of plunder, or to burglarize or steal, during a riot, civil unrest or natural disaster. Apply the word looters carefully and specifically to those who engage in looting, do not overuse, and avoid the labeling and the stigmatizing of larger communities, groups or all protesters. The word looters applied to large groups has carried racial overtones in the past. Whenever possible, explain circumstances. For example, A group of people at the protest broke into the store and took whatever was on the shelves . People engaged in looting may be petty criminals, individual community members or criminal gangs who have no relation to any nearby protests. In severe emergencies, such as hurricanes and floods that disrupt supplies, people sometimes steal to obtain water, food, medicine or essentials to survive. In all cases, it is important to explain the actions and the context in detail. Mace A trademark, shortened from Chemical Mace , for a brand of tear gas that is packaged in an aerosol canister and temporarily stuns its victims. nolo contendere The literal meaning is, \"I do not wish to contend.\" Terms such as pleaded no contest or a no-contest plea are acceptable in all references. When defendants in a criminal case enter this plea, it means that they are not admitting guilt but is stating that they will offer no defense. The person is then subject to being judged guilty and punished as if there had been a guilty plea or a conviction. The principal difference is that the defendant retains the option of denying the same charge in another legal proceeding. officer-involved, police-involved Avoid this vague jargon for shootings and other cases involving police. Be specific about what happened. If police use the term, ask for detail. How was the officer or officers involved? Who did the shooting? If the information is not available or not provided, spell that out. pardon, parole, probation The terms often are confused, but each has a specific meaning. Do not use them interchangeably. A pardon forgives and releases a person from further punishment. It is granted by a chief of state or a governor. By itself, it does not expunge a record of conviction, if one exists, and it does not by itself restore civil rights. A general pardon , usually for political offenses, is called amnesty . Parole is the release of a person in prison before the sentence has expired, on condition of good behavior. It is granted by a parole board, part of the executive branch of government, and can be revoked only by the board. Probation is the suspension of sentence for a person convicted, but not yet imprisoned, on condition of good behavior. It is imposed and revoked only by a judge. pedophilia Sexual desire felt by an adult for children. Do not use in a legal sense such as a pedophilia conviction or convicted pedophile . Instead, refer to the charges. For example, convicted of child sexual abuse; conviction on charges of sexually abusing children . prison, jail, prisoner, inmate, incarcerated person Do not use prison and jail or prisoner and inmate interchangeably. Prison is a generic term for facilities that usually confine people serving incarceration sentences of more than a year. They typically are run by states or the federal government, or by private companies. The term may be used for federal facilities often known as penitentiaries and for what are sometimes called correctional institutions , as well as for state prisons . A jail is normally used to confine people serving sentences for lesser crimes and for less than a year; people awaiting trial or sentencing on either felony or misdemeanor charges; and people confined for civil matters such as failure to pay alimony. Jails usually are run by local authorities such as a city or county. Capitalize the full proper name of a prison, jail, penitentiary, etc. Lowercase uses such as the county jail, the state prison . Use lowercase for all plural constructions: the Colorado and Kansas state penitentiaries . See https://bop.gov for more detail on federal facilities. Do not use the term prisoner for someone confined in a jail. An inmate can be in either a prison or a jail. When possible, use person-first language to describe someone who is incarcerated : A man who is incarcerated in an Alabama prison is appealing his sentence instead of A state prison inmate is appealing his sentence . The state is planning more education programs for people in prison . A man facing execution instead of a death-row inmate . Do not use felon , convict or ex-con as nouns. privacy Special care should be taken with regard to publishing the names of people under age 18 involved or suspected in crimes, or of people who may have been the victims of sexual assault or other abuse. Generally, we do not identify people under 18 who are accused of crimes, or transmit images that would reveal their identity. However, managers may authorize exceptions. Considerations in granting exceptions may include the severity of the crime or alleged crime; whether police have formally released the suspect's name; and whether the person has been formally charged as an adult. Other considerations might include public safety, such as when the youth is the subject of a search; or widespread publication of the suspect's name, making the identity de facto public knowledge. In some situations, state or national laws may determine whether the person's name can be published. We normally do not identify, in text or through images, people under 18 who are witnesses to crimes. We also do not identify, in text or through images, people who may have been sexually assaulted (unless they have come forward and voluntarily identified themselves). We should also use discretion in naming victims of other extremely severe abuse. Sometimes a person may be identified by AP in an abduction or search situation, and it develops later that — because of a sexual assault or other reason — the name should not be used. In such cases we have sometimes refrained from using the identification in future coverage. We do not name suspects or transmit images of them in brief stories about minor crimes when there is little chance AP will cover the case beyond the initial arrest. We also do not link to local stories about such incidents where the arrested person's name or mug shot might be used. The policy does not apply to serious charges or crimes, such as those involving violence or abuse of the public trust, or cases of a fugitive on the run. See juvenile, minor ; sexual abuse, sexual assault, sexual harassment, sexual misconduct . prosecutor Capitalize before a name when it is the formal title. In most cases, however, the formal title is a term such as attorney general, state's attorney or U.S. attorney . If so, use the formal title on first reference. Lowercase prosecutor if used before a name on a subsequent reference, generally to help the reader distinguish between prosecutor and defense attorney without having to look back to the start of the story. See titles . prostitute Avoid terms like child, underage or teenage prostitute , except in quotations or in referring to criminal charges that may use these terms. The phrasing can suggest that a child is voluntarily trading sex for money. Minors are not able to consent. (The age of consent varies by jurisdiction; know the law of the state or jurisdiction in question.) See sex work, prostitution . riot, unrest, protest, demonstration, uprising, revolt Use care in deciding which term best applies: A riot is a wild or violent disturbance of the peace involving a group of people. The term riot suggests uncontrolled chaos and pandemonium. Focusing on rioting and property destruction rather than underlying grievance has been used in the past to stigmatize broad swaths of people protesting against lynching or police brutality or for racial justice, going back at least to the urban uprisings of the 1960s in the U.S. Inciting to riot is a longstanding criminal offense involving two or more people. In the United States, a federal criminal anti-riot act was enacted in 1968 in response to violent civil disturbances and protests of that era. Unrest is a vaguer, milder and less emotional term for a condition of angry discontent and protest verging on revolt. Protest and demonstration refer to specific actions such as marches, sit-ins, rallies or other actions meant to register dissent. They can be legal or illegal, organized or spontaneous, peaceful or violent, and involve any number of people. Revolt and uprising both suggest a broader political dimension or civil upheavals, a sustained period of protests, or unrest against powerful groups or governing systems. sexual abuse, sexual assault, sexual harassment, sexual misconduct Proceed with care when using these terms, along with others such as rape, molestation, unwanted sex, sexual relationship , etc. Authorities, people making accusations and people who stand accused use a variety of language and terminology to cover a wide spectrum of actions or behavior. Interpretations can vary widely. Do not simply repeat those terms. Instead, pay close attention to legal definitions, which vary by jurisdiction, and the wording of criminal charges or convictions. Consider the nuance of each situation and what may be conveyed or perceived by the language used. As with all accusations, allegations should be well documented and corroborated. Always seek comment from accused individuals or their representatives. We generally do not identify, in text or images, those who say they have been sexually assaulted or subjected to extreme abuse. We may identify victims of sexual assault or extreme abuse when victims publicly identify themselves. Decisions on identifying people who say they have been subject to other forms of sexual misconduct should be made on a case-by-case basis, depending on the nature of the allegations. Among points to consider: Terms such as rape, sexual assault and sexual harassment have legal definitions that vary by jurisdiction. Knowing the definitions is essential when deciding which term(s) are accurate and appropriate. Depending on state law, rape and sexual assault can include sexual contact by force, threat or coercion, or after the accuser's incapacitation due to drugs or alcohol. When reporting on court cases, use the language contained in the charges and/or conviction. If a defendant is charged with sexual assault , do not say he is charged with rape . If a defendant is convicted on a charge of sexual misconduct , do not say he was convicted of having unwanted sex with the victim or convicted of rape . If someone is charged with sexual harassment , do not say they are accused of sexual assault . It may be appropriate to explain why a story does or does not use certain terms: The woman said she was raped; prosecutors charged the man with sexual assault under the definitions in state law. Another example: He was convicted of taking indecent liberties, which is the formal criminal charge . The term sexual relationship implies consent. Under state laws, a minor cannot give sexual consent to an adult. Thus, do not write that an adult had a sexual relationship with or had sex with a minor or vice versa. (The age of consent varies by jurisdiction; know the law of the state or jurisdiction in question.) In other cases, consider carefully whether relationship is an appropriate term. A key issue in many cases is the element of consent, and definitions of what constitutes consent vary. Refer to the laws of the jurisdiction in question. The terms sexual harassment and sexual misconduct generally denote behavior that does not include rape, sexual assault, sexual abuse or sexual violence . Sexual misconduct is preferred over sexual harassment , as it encompasses a broader range of misbehavior and does not run the risk of diminishing an alleged act. Use sexual harassment when reporting on a specific legal charge or formal Equal Employment Opportunity Commission complaint. The term sexual violence may occasionally be used in broad references to sexual assault, rape and sexual abuse . Use the more specific wording for individual cases. After using a broad term such as sexual misconduct or sexual assault , describe generally the kinds of behavior alleged or admitted to — such as groping, unwanted kissing, disrobing, verbal abuse, digital penetration, oral sex, etc. Provide enough detail to make clear the alleged crimes, while avoiding a level of detail that could be perceived as gratuitous. Do not refer to a person making an accusation as a victim unless the accused person has been convicted. Avoid the term alleged victim . The term accuser is acceptable, especially when referring to a group of people: Bill Cosby's accusers . Limit its use when referring to an individual in favor of the correct pronoun. The woman said the defendant forcibly kissed her . RESOURCES : https://www.eeoc.gov/harassment https://apps.rainn.org/policy/ See anonymous sources ; privacy . sex work, prostitution Sex work and sex worker are acceptable as umbrella terms for prostitution, prostitute and other words describing the exchange of sexual services for goods or money — legal or not. Use more specific terms like prostitute, dancer, stripper, porn performer, online performer , etc., if needed for clarity or if the subjects describe themselves as such. Also use more specific descriptions of a situation, such as trafficking , if needed. Use prostitute and prostitution if those are the terms used in quotations, criminal charges, legislation, etc. Supporters of the term sex work argue that the phrasing provides dignity to people using the means available to them for survival and lessens the shame associated with a universally acknowledged but long-stigmatized line of work. Detractors of the terminology note that activities described as sex work — particularly prostitution — can involve coercion, exploitation, trafficking or slavery, and that minors are unable to legally consent to such \"work.\" Avoid terms like child prostitute or underage sex worker that can suggest a child is voluntarily trading sex for money. Though some underage people seek out sex work for financial support, they are in most cases not legally able to consent to sex. Instead, use specific phrasing that conveys context and relevance. Avoid escort as a synonym for prostitute . Escorts are often paid for their time or companionship instead of or in addition to sexual services. See human smuggling/people smuggling, human trafficking/people trafficking . slay, slaying, slain Avoid this journalese. Use kill, killing or killed instead. See homicide, murder, manslaughter ; and cliches, jargon . survivor, victim Use these terms with care because they can be imprecise and politically and legally fraught. Survivor can denote someone who has lived through an injury or disease, but also can apply to someone who endured a threat but escaped injury altogether. Example: a mass shooting survivor . Likewise, victim can create confusion because it can variously mean someone killed, injured or subjected to mistreatment such as sexual misconduct. Be specific if there is room for confusion: The ceremony honored people wounded in the mass shooting , not The ceremony honored victims and/or survivors of the mass shooting . The play told the story of those killed in the hurricane , not The play told the stories of the hurricane's victims . Also be alert to potential biases and assumptions inherent in the word victim . A phrase such as AIDS victim , for instance, not only makes it unclear whether the subject is alive or dead, but many AIDS patients do not consider themselves victims. Instead, use neutral, precise descriptions: He has AIDS. She has hepatitis . In crime stories, avoid alleged victim if possible; it is too easily construed as skepticism. In stories in which sexual misconduct or other allegations are leveled, consider calling the person making the allegations an accuser instead of a victim if shorthand is needed, to avoid implications of guilt on the part of the accused. Survivor is often used to describe people who have lived through physical or emotional trauma, as in abuse or rape survivor . It is best to be specific when referring to individuals, especially if the person was never in danger of death. Use of survivor gets more latitude when describing groups. A group of Holocaust survivors met at the memorial . See diseases ; homicide, murder, manslaughter ; allege ; sexual abuse, sexual assault, sexual harassment, sexual misconduct . suspect The word refers to a person who police, prosecutors or other authorities believe or say committed a crime. Do not use it to mean a person of unknown identity who definitely committed a crime. In other words, don't substitute suspect for robber, killer, rapist , etc., in describing an event, even if authorities phrase it that way. Correct: Police said the robber stole 14 diamond rings; the thief ran away . Incorrect: Police said the suspect stole 14 diamond rings; the suspect ran away . Conversely, don't substitute robber, killer, rapist , etc., when suspect is indeed the correct word. Correct: Police arrested the suspect the next day . Incorrect: Police arrested the robber the next day . Also see separate allege and accused, alleged, suspected entries. For guidance on related terms, see arrest and indict. Taser Taser is the trademark name for the energy weapon manufactured by Axon and used by the vast majority of law enforcement agencies in the United States. In the U.S., use the term Taser instead of stun gun ; the two are not the same. Stun guns use electricity to inflict sharp, localized pain on contact. A Taser shoots probes that transmit electricity, causing a person's muscles to flex in what is known as neuromuscular incapacitation and temporarily immobilizing the person. Some older-model Taser weapons have a feature, known as drive-stun , which can be used to inflict localized pain like a stun gun. But most police in the U.S. use Tasers by shooting prongs. Tasers also are used by many but not all law enforcement agencies outside the U.S. In those jurisdictions, try to determine the type of weapon involved. Don't use verbs like tasered or tased . Instead, refer to someone being shocked with a Taser . When verb forms appear in direct quotations, use lowercase. terrorism The calculated use of violence, especially against civilians, to create terror to disrupt and demoralize societies for political ends. Israel, the U.S., the European Union and some other Western countries have branded Hamas and Hezbollah as terrorist groups. However, the terms terrorism and terrorist have become politicized, and often are applied inconsistently around the world. Because they can be used to label such a wide range of actions and events, and because the debate around them is so intense, detailing what happened is more precise and better serves audiences. Instead of labeling an attack or attacker as terrorism or terrorist , AP describes the specific atrocity, massacre, bombing, or assassination, and so on. We do not use the terms terrorism or terrorist for specific actions or groups, other than when attributed to authorities or others. We continue to use the terms in broad references to terrorism as a threat and anti-terrorism efforts, fear of terror , etc. trusty An incarcerated person considered trustworthy and allowed special privileges. youth, youths Applicable from age 13 until 18th birthday.

{"source_url": "https://www.apstylebook.com/ap_stylebook/arabic-names", "entry_header": "Arabic names", "text_content": "In general, use an English spelling that approximates the way a name sounds in Arabic. If an individual has a preferred spelling in English, use that. If usage has established a particular spelling, use that. Problems in transliteration of Arabic names often are traceable to pronunciations that vary from region to region. The g , for example, is pronounced like the g of go mainly in Egypt, and the j of joy in the rest of the Arab world. Thus it is Gamal in Egypt and Jamal in nations on the peninsula. Follow local practice in deciding which letter to use. Arabs commonly are known by two names ( Hassan Nasrallah ), or by three ( Mohammed Mahdi Akef ). Follow the individual's preference on first reference. On second reference, use only the final name in the sequence. The articles al- or el- may be used or dropped depending on the person's preference or established usage. ( Ayman al-Zawahri , al-Zawahri , or Moammar Gadhafi , Gadhafi ). The article al- or el- should not be capitalized. The Arabic word for son ( ibn or bin ) is sometimes part of a name. On second reference, it is often dropped, using only the final name. In cases of personal preference or common usage, it should be retained. ( Osama bin Laden , bin Laden ; Abdul-Aziz bin Baz , bin Baz ). The word abu or abou , meaning father of , occasionally is used as a last name ( Abdel-Halim Abou Ghazala ). Capitalize and repeat it on second reference: Abou Ghazala . The word abdul , meaning \"servant of (God),\" generally does not stand alone as a name, except sometimes in South Asia and Afghanistan. It is used in combination with a second name (an Arabic word for an attribute of God). This combination should be hyphenated, unless the individual prefers otherwise, and capitalized ( Adil Abdul-Mahdi , Abdul-Mahdi ). In Egypt and some other countries, Abdul is often written Abdel , reflecting local pronunciation. For royalty, the titles king , emir , sheikh and imam are used, but prince usually replaces emir . Some Arabs are known only by the title and a given name on first reference ( King Abdullah ). Others are known by a complete name ( Sheikh Mohammed bin Rashid Al Maktoum ). Follow the common usage on first reference. On second reference, drop the title and use only the first name ( Abdullah, Mohammed ). The full names of many Gulf royals include the word Al , which in their case should be capitalized without a hyphen since it means family of . The al should be capitalized in front of most Muslim and Arab institutions, universities, newspapers and major mosques, as in Al-Azhar , the university in Cairo; Al-Aqsa , the Jerusalem mosque, the newspaper Al-Ahram and the satellite television news network Al Jazeera (which does not use the hyphen in its name)."}

They also charge companies, municipalities and even foreign governments that wish to sell debt and have it rated. The ratings are a fundamental way for investors to form an opinion on whether they are likely to be repaid, and then decide whether the interest rate is high enough to compensate for the risk that they may get back none or only a portion of their investment (in the case of a bankruptcy or some other adverse event). The ratings also effectively set benchmarks for how much interest companies will have to pay to sell bonds, commercial paper, preferred stock and for bank loans they obtain. The higher the grade, the lower the interest rate a borrower must pay. S&P Global's bond ratings, for example, include 10 categories that are referred to as investment-grade , from AAA to BBB-, given to borrowers with the strongest ability to repay. Another six categories, from BB+ to CCC-, are assigned to more speculative securities that are commonly referred to as junk or high-yield debt . The lowest category, D, is for securities that are in payment default. A reduction in the rating of a company's debt to non-investment-grade can force some mutual funds and pension funds to sell those bonds because they are prohibited from holding junk debt."}

In general, different cryptocurrencies use different blockchains, although some new cryptocurrencies have been established on existing blockchains. Blockchain records are stored in a “peer-to-peer” network that updates continually so that copies of these records are stored across computers around the world. Blockchain records are secured through cryptography. Participants have their own private keys that act as personal digital signatures for accessing their funds. Cryptocurrency transactions are digitally signed each time cryptocurrency changes hands. miners, validators Blockchains are constructed by people known as miners or validators , who verify cryptocurrency transactions so that no one can spend the same token twice. Miners use their computing power to compete to solve a math puzzle. The first to solve the puzzle gets to add the verified transaction to the blockchain. This method is used for the bitcoin and dogecoin blockchains. Validators use a proof of stake method, where they pledge or “stake” a portion of their holdings of a particular cryptocurrency and are chosen to attest to the validity of a transaction. Ethereum switched to proof of stake in 2022. Miners and validators receive cryptocurrency as a reward. Web3 A catchall term for the prospect of a new stage of the internet driven by the cryptocurrency-related technology blockchain. nonfungible token, NFT Artificially scarce digital objects created by using blockchain technology to mint “unique” versions of digital artwork, sports memorabilia, famous photographs and anything else that can be digitized.

{"source_url": "https://www.apstylebook.com/ap_stylebook/bankruptcy-3", "entry_header": "Bankruptcy", "text_content": "Bankruptcy categories – personal and business Federal courts have exclusive jurisdiction over bankruptcy cases, and each of the 94 federal judicial districts handles bankruptcy matters. The primary purposes of the federal bankruptcy laws are to give an honest debtor a \"fresh start\" in life by relieving the debtor of most debts, and to repay creditors in an orderly manner to the extent that the debtor has property available for payment. Bankruptcies can also be voluntary or involuntary . Chapter 7 of the Bankruptcy Code is available to both individual and business debtors. Its purpose is to achieve a fair distribution to creditors of the debtor's available non-exempt property. It provides a fresh financial start for individuals, although not all debt is wiped away; debts for certain taxes, fraudulently incurred credit card debt, family support obligations — including child support and alimony — and most student loans must still be repaid.There are strict access limits to this form of bankruptcy as well. Those deemed by a \"means test\" to have at least $100 a month left over after paying certain debts and expenses will have to file a five-year repayment plan under the more restrictive Chapter 13 instead. When a company files for Chapter 7, it usually leads to liquidation. But a company in Chapter 7 proceedings can continue to operate under the direction of a court trustee until the matter is settled, and if it can settle with creditors in the interim, it may not have to be liquidated. Chapter 11 of the Bankruptcy Code is available for both business and consumer debtors. Its purpose is to rehabilitate a business as a going concern or reorganize an individual's finances through a court-approved reorganization plan . When we refer to such a filing, we should say the company is seeking Chapter 11 protection . This action frees a company from the threat of creditors' lawsuits while it reorganizes its finances. The debtor's reorganization plan must be accepted by a majority of its creditors. Unless the court rules otherwise, the debtor remains in control of the business and its assets. Chapter 12 of the Bankruptcy Code is designed to give special debt relief to a family farmer with regular income from farming. Chapter 13 of the Bankruptcy Code is known as the wage earner's plan. Under Chapter 13, a person who still has a steady income can set up a payment plan for all or part of their debt. That repayment plan is set up for a duration of three or five years, depending on whether the person’s monthly income is above or below the state median. Chapter 15 of the Bankruptcy Code deals with cross-border bankruptcies. It is a way for companies with U.S. assets that are organized or nominally headquartered overseas to file bankruptcy in that foreign jurisdiction and in the U.S. as well, and have the U.S. court recognize the foreign bankruptcy as the primary one. How to prepare if a big corporate bankruptcy filing seems imminent Burdensome debt and the refusal of lenders to extend new loans are the common denominators for most companies seeking bankruptcy court protection. Those tend not to crop up suddenly, which means you should be able to judge the likelihood that one of your companies may be filing. Setting up SEC filing alerts for companies of interest is highly recommended. Alerts can be filtered to search for crucial filings such as an 8-K. Companies rarely use the word “bankruptcy” in such filings. A common phrase found in filings from a company in trouble is “going concern.” While the phrase in legal terms means that a company has the wherewithal to continue operations for a year or more, no company that is not in considerable danger would include it in an SEC filing. It is mandatory for company executives or auditors to sound a warning in financial filings if there is any doubt of their ability to make it through the year and the phrase “going concern,” often buried deep within a filing, is a red flag that will typically result in a precipitous decline in the company’s stock. A general understanding of balance sheets and income statements will go a long way. How much debt does the company have and how much of it must be repaid or refinanced in this quarter or the quarters to come? Have they demonstrated an inability to raise cash through the sale of stock or debt financing? Has cash flow gone negative? After a company seeks Chapter 11 protection, holders of the company's debt are often the best source of information about the status of bankruptcy negotiations since they often stand to gain control of the company in the reorganization process. For private companies (those that are not publicly traded), bond holders are often a good source of information. Company officials will not telegraph an upcoming bankruptcy filing, but it is a good practice to let the company’s media representative of your interest. Those individuals typically maintain mailing lists to advise of crucial developments. Another question to ask is: What will happen to the company's employees? When a company seeks bankruptcy protection, it often pushes for job cuts, pay cuts and reductions in benefits. If any workers are represented by unions, those unions will likely fight those cuts. A company seeking Chapter 11 protection will sometimes try to use bankruptcy court to achieve concessions if it can't reach an agreement on its own with unions. So stay in contact with union representatives to keep up with out-of-court negotiations, and check docket reports on Pacer or free platforms like Courtlistener for requests for permission to impose wage concessions, to reject union contracts or anything similar. Also, companies seeking bankruptcy protection often turn over their pension plans to the Pension Benefit Guaranty Corporation, the federal pension insurance agency ( http://www.pbgc.gov ). And a reminder on tracking a company's stock after it files for bankruptcy: Companies are usually delisted by the New York Stock Exchange and the Nasdaq stock market after they seek bankruptcy court protection. That means they usually begin trading on the over-the-counter market known as the Pink Sheets . The letter Q at the end of a ticker signifies that the company is operating under bankruptcy protection and PK means it trades on the Pink Sheets. (Example: Delphi Corp. went from DPH on the New York Stock Exchange to DPHIQ.PK – four letters required in the ticker symbol for bankrupt companies — on the Pink Sheets.) Is it a reorganization or a liquidation? Knowing the answer to this question is key to how we describe what is happening to a company and how it might impact customers and employees. If it's a Chapter 11 filing and the company hopes to stay in business, don't say \"Company XX filed for bankruptcy on DATE TK ...\" Instead, we should say \"Company XX sought bankruptcy court protection on DATE TK ...\" If a company closes its doors, says it's unable to raise new cash and is going out of business via a Chapter 7 filing, spell that out in the lead. Secured and unsecured creditors When you borrow money to buy a car, the lender is a secured creditor ; that creditor gets to reclaim the car if you stop making payments. Similarly, companies usually have to pledge some kind of collateral when they sell bonds or otherwise borrow money. There can be several levels or rankings of security pledged for various categories of a company's debt. It is important to know which creditor stands first, second and so on in line for repayment if a company files for bankruptcy because their claims and desires often conflict with what management wants to happen. In a bankruptcy reorganization, secured lenders and debt holders obviously want to be repaid 100 cents on the dollar. Management often is against that idea, because the company needs whatever money it still has to continue operations. What often happens is that after extensive negotiations (and big lawyer bills) secured debt holders agree to exchange their securities for new shares of stock (i.e., equity) in the post-bankruptcy company, which emerges as a consequence with a much-reduced debt load. So what happens to existing shareholders ? In most cases, their shares become worthless . But every so often, secured debt holders' claims can be satisfied in a way that leaves some residual equity value in the company. But even then, existing shareholders' ownership stake in the company is often severely diluted by the issuance of new shares to former debt holders. That's why the stocks of companies seeking bankruptcy protection often continue to trade at a few dollars a share. It's mostly a fool's game, but something we need to be able to explain as part of our reporting and writing. Prepackaged bankruptcies and debtor-in-possession financing Companies heading toward bankruptcy sometimes start negotiations with major secured creditors on what is known as a prepackaged bankruptcy filing. If a company can reach agreement on key details before the bankruptcy court supervision begins, it can speed its eventual reorganization and exit from bankruptcy. Known as an out-of-court restructuring plan, it is filed simultaneously with a Chapter 11 petition. But such plans require the approval of at least two-thirds in amount and more than one-half in the number of allowed claims held by creditors. These prepackaged plans, as well as regular Chapter 11 reorganizations, often are accompanied by what is known as debtor-in-possession financing . This is a term for new money extended by a lender in Chapter 11 cases. U.S. Bankruptcy Code often allows additional protections for such lenders to encourage debt capital that might allow a company to achieve a successful restructuring. DIP financing can be a profitable line of business for banks. And companies' ability to obtain it often is a critical factor in whether they continue to operate or have to shut down. Emerging from bankruptcy When the reorganization is completed and a company emerges from bankruptcy, we should be able to spell out how much of the company's debt has been wiped away. If debt holders swap their holdings for shares of the reorganized company, spell that out and explain what role they will play. Also include whether the company attracted new equity holders as part of the reorganization."}

These days, the term is usually shorthand for information technology such as technologies used in computing, robotics, communications and artificial intelligence, as well as the tools and processes used to manufacture devices from computer chips to smartphones to satellites. In daily usage, technology is most often used to describe internet-connected smart devices, especially smartphones; the apps they run; and the services and platforms they connect to. Both technology and the language and terms associated with it are rapidly evolving; AP Stylebook Online provides the most current guidance. Consider your audience carefully when describing technology. Younger generations have grown up with technology and require less explanation of terms and services they find familiar, while the same language may bewilder some older readers. It is safe to assume that services in widespread use — Facebook and Google, for instance — will be recognized by all demographics. Other terms, such as zero-day vulnerability , are not familiar to many and should be explained for general audiences. When in doubt, explain potentially unfamiliar terms and avoid online or technical jargon. There are, of course, many other forms of technology . Biotechnology , for instance, is short for biological technology , and refers to the development of medical therapies using modern understanding of genetics, immunology and other biological processes. Explain more specific uses of the term, usually by supplying an appropriate modifier: industrial technology, software technology, environmental technology and so forth. High technology is an outdated term for information technology . The modifier high-tech remains appropriate as a signifier of novel or unfamiliar technological developments: The restaurant's robotic chefs prepare high-tech cuisine and serve it to diners with a minimum of fuss . In common usage, the technology industry includes companies engaged in the development of information technology.

Also can be called self-driving . The term driverless should not be used unless there is no human backup driver.\nAs of early 2024, there were no autonomous vehicles for sale to the public in the U.S. Some autonomous vehicles are in use by ride-hailing and goods-delivery services. Autonomous semis are being tested. If a human is expected to supervise or take action, the vehicle is not autonomous. In cases where a company is testing what it considers to be an autonomous vehicle on public roads with a human driver supervising, this should be called an autonomous test vehicle . Some vehicles have driver-assist systems that can perform tasks such as changing lanes, driving at low speeds, or keeping a safe distance from vehicles ahead of them, but they still need human supervision. These should be referred to as partially automated . Avoid the term semiautonomous , because it implies that these systems can drive themselves. As of early 2024, human drivers must be ready to intervene at any time. Nearly all automakers now sell their own version of partially automated driving systems. Some of the best known are Tesla's Autopilot , General Motors' Super Cruise and Nissan's ProPilot Assist . Autopilot, ProPilot Assist and other trade names should be capitalized; the generic use of autopilot is lowercase. avatar An image or other digital representation chosen by or assigned to users in an online service, video game or virtual reality environment.

When necessary to use, follow the general rule for prefixes, which calls for no hyphen in most cases. For example: cyberattack, cyberbullying, cybersecurity . But Cyber Monday, cyber liability insurance . cyberattack A computer operation carried out over a device or network that causes physical damage or significant disruption. The term is routinely overused — mostly as regards cyberespionage, used inaccurately sometimes to describe intrusions or breaches that do not cause harm or disruption — at least not immediately. darknet A part of the internet hosted within an encrypted network and accessible only through specialized anonymity-providing tools, most notably the Tor Browser. Examples of darknets include the Tor network, I2P and Freenet . Do not confuse darknets , which are generally associated with illegal or antisocial activity, and the much broader deep web . deepfake (n., adj.) A manipulated video or other digital representation produced by sophisticated machine learning techniques that yield seemingly realistic, but fabricated, images and sounds. Deepfake video can, for instance, make it appear that people said or did things they did not actually say or do. Deepfake or deepfake video is acceptable, but must be explained on first reference. See misinformation, fact checks, fake news . deep web A general term for portions of the internet that are not indexed by standard search engines such as Google and Bing, although they can be accessed by direct links. The deep web hosts a vast amount of legal but nonpublic activity, including private corporate websites known as intranets , secured databases, financial and medical accounts, legal files, and other data protected by paywalls or requiring secure logins. The darknet is a subset of the deep web . device memory, device storage The memory of a computer, phone or other digital device holds data needed for current operations; it is typically wiped clean when the device shuts down. Device storage , by contrast, holds data indefinitely unless deliberately erased. Memory and storage are both measured in bytes . Storage can take the form of a traditional magnetic hard-disk drive or a solid-state drive, which keeps data on semiconductor chips and is widely used in smartphones and other portable electronics. digital advertising, internet advertising, online advertising Advertising delivered digitally, such as on a website or an app, often targeted to a person's location, interests and other preferences. Ad revenue finances many free tech services, such as Facebook and Google, but it has also drawn scrutiny over data collection and privacy. See internet privacy . Types of digital advertising include: search advertising Ads, usually in text, that appear alongside search results, targeted to the specific keywords typed by the user. They can also appear on third-party websites such as news sites. display advertising A video or image ad displayed on a website or app. It can be targeted based on keywords in an article or the specific user's personal profile. video advertising Can include traditional television commercials shown over the internet. It can appear before or during breaks in streaming video or in a pop-up window when visiting a website. affiliate advertising An advertising model in which a company pays a third party for bringing traffic or leads to its service or products. For example, if a third-party website posts a link to Amazon, it could receive commissions for products bought through that link. With most types of digital advertising, an advertiser can specify the intended audience based on location, demographics, hobbies, interests and other factors. With some services, including Google and Facebook, a business can share a list of its existing customers, based on unique identifiers such as email addresses, and have the service find other customers with similar demographics, behavior and other attributes. Facebook calls this look-alike audience . Google calls it similar audience . Other types of targeting include: retargeting A method of targeting an audience based on previous behavior. For example, if someone clicks on an ad or visits a shopping site but does not buy, an ad for that same product could appear later when visiting another website or app. microtargeting The practice of targeting ads to even smaller groups of people, sometimes even individuals, by specifying a collection of user attributes to match. For example, advertisers can seek users who live in specific ZIP codes, have kids, like football, watch \"Saturday Night Live\" and have attended a specific school. The more specific the requirements, the narrower the audience. Additional advertising terms: pay per click A form of paid advertising in which an advertiser pays the service for every click made by visitors. Hyphenate as a modifier: pay-per-click advertising . pay per impression A form of paid advertising in which an advertiser pays the service every time the ad is shown, regardless of whether the user clicks on the ad. Hyphenate as a modifier: pay-per-impression advertising . click-through rate The number of clicks based on a set number of impressions. Many services now let advertisers specify how much they are willing to pay per impression or click. The service would then display the highest bidder for a particular set of keywords or other targeting attributes. This approach is often referred to as an auction, or real-time bidding . digital assistant, virtual assistant, voice assistant Artificial intelligence service offered via phones or home devices that responds to spoken questions or commands. Some systems allow questions or commands to be typed. Major voice assistants include Alexa from Amazon, Siri from Apple, Google Assistant from Google, Bixby from Samsung and Cortana from Microsoft. Although many of these assistants have traditionally female names, do not refer to them using gendered pronouns except in direct quotations. These services have experienced some problems with privacy. Some users have reported cases in which a device mistakenly identified command words and then recorded and sent background conversations online. Audio recordings of voice commands are typically kept online and can be sought in investigations and lawsuits. Major companies offer users the ability to review and delete recordings. Some tech companies also allow their employees or contractors to review voice interaction for quality control, although users can often opt out of such reviews. digital wallet, mobile wallet A phone app used to store credit cards, gift cards, loyalty cards, tickets and other transactional items. Such a wallet can include cards used for mobile payments and other digital items such as vaccination records. The terms digital wallets or mobile wallets are acceptable, but depending on the audience, the wallet terminology may require explanation on first use. Avoid e-wallet . See mobile payment . digitize, digitalize The term digitize generally has a narrow meaning and refers to a conversion of everyday analog information – sights, sounds, etc. –  to digital form: to digitize a document .

There are also domains that use non-Latin characters such as those in Arabic and Japanese. Some domain suffixes are restricted to specific types of institutions such as banks, but institutions aren't required to use any particular suffix. Though domain names are less prominent these days as more people reach websites using search engines and apps, they are still important for email addresses, billboards and other nondigital advertising. When writing about the suffix, use .com, .org , etc. Reserve dot-com for historical references to online businesses in the early days of the web and to the 2000 financial crash that followed the dot-com bubble . See DNS ; dot-com . dot-com An older and informal description of companies that do business mainly on the internet.

The company adopted the name Meta Platforms in October 2021 to signal its intention of building the metaverse , a proposed immersive digital environment that could in theory supplant the internet. See Meta Platforms ; Facebook (social platform) ; Family of Apps ; metaverse . Facebook (social platform) The world's most popular social network, with about 3.07 billion monthly active users as of Dec. 31, 2023. It is owned by Meta Platforms , the company formerly known as Facebook . Facebook, the social platform, connects billions of users and tracks their activity closely, allowing it to build individual profiles it can use for selling targeted advertising. That business has been hugely profitable. But Facebook's technology for keeping users as engaged as possible has also drawn significant criticism from those who say it foments hate speech, genocide and extremism; invades users' privacy; and promotes dangerous misinformation. Whistleblower and former Facebook data scientist Frances Haugen testified before Congress in October 2021 that the company knew that its platforms (Facebook as well as Instagram) spread misinformation and content that harms children but refused to make changes that could hurt its profit. Facebook is also under scrutiny for alleged anticompetitive practices and has been sued by the Federal Trade Commission and several states on those grounds. It faces lawsuits by dozens of states for harming young people's mental health. See Meta Platforms . Family of Apps Meta Platforms' name for its social apps and services. It includes the Facebook social network, Messenger , Instagram and WhatsApp .

It can include the technology behind mobile and online banking, money transfers among friends and tools for finding cheaper loans. Fintech can involve both consumer-facing products and back-end services and can come from both startups and established financial institutions. Fintech can be used on first reference but should be defined in the story if it isn't clear from context. Use lowercase except at the start of sentences or in the formal name of a company. firewall A device or software designed to stop malicious or unauthorized internet traffic from reaching a computer or local data network. Many firewalls also inspect outgoing traffic. 5G, 4G, 3G Types of mobile network technology. 5G — a shorthand term for fifth generation wireless networks — refers to a faster alternative to the 4G mobile networks that have been in widespread U.S. service since the mid-2010s. In addition to faster speeds, 5G networks promise reduced signal lag, which can improve performance for some services. Only newer phones updated for 5G will work with these new networks. Some providers are also using 5G for fixed mobile networks that can deliver broadband speeds to homes and businesses. 3G refers to 4G's slower predecessor. Major 3G networks in the U.S. largely shut down in 2022, although in some other countries they are scheduled to remain operational for several years. 3G, 4G and 5G are acceptable on first reference, but should be explained in stories as cellular or mobile networks . Acceptable descriptions of 5G include faster, latest or next-generation network . Avoid the term fifth generation . No certification is required for a phone company to use any of these terms in marketing materials; be wary of possible deception. Some companies have used the 5G label for services that aren't technically 5G . Do not confuse these terms with Wi-Fi , which describes short-range wireless networks that do not use cellular technology. See Wi-Fi . 4K The term typically refers to video with 2,160 lines of vertical resolution, producing sharper images than high-definition video. The name derives from a version that offers 4,096 lines of horizontal resolution, though the term now usually refers to a version with just 3,840 horizontal lines, also known as ultrahigh definition , or UHD . Many TVs now come with 4K capabilities even though not all movies and shows are available in 4K. 4K is considered a successor to high-definition video . friend, follow, like Acceptable in a social media context as both nouns and verbs. Actions by which users connect to other users on social networks and engage with their content. GDPR The European Union's General Data Protection Regulation , a set of strict data privacy rules for citizens of the 27 nation EU that took effect in 2018. GDPR has been widely described as the world's strongest privacy law and gives people in the EU more control over their personal data. GDPR is acceptable on second reference, but use sparingly. Consider phrasing such as the rules or the privacy rules on later references. geolocation, geotagging The act of adding geographical metadata to pieces of media, social media updates or other digital content. Also, the use of a user's physical location to determine access to certain information. The metadata itself is an item's geolocation or geotag . A geotagged tweet, post, photo or video would contain information about the latitude and longitude of the location where the photo was taken, or possibly the name of the city and/or country, or of a landmark or establishment where the user has chosen to check in. GIF Acronym for Graphics Interchange Format , a compression format for images. In common usage, the term refers to images produced in this format for online use, frequently in the context of humorous social media posts. The pronunciation of GIF is disputed, with different camps preferring either a soft-g or hard-g initial consonant. The English language has no settled pronunciation rules for words beginning with the letters \"gi,\" suggesting that this question is unlikely to be resolved to anyone's satisfaction. GIF is acceptable in copy but should be explained in the story. Use lowercase in a file name. For guidance on quoting social media posts with GIFs , see quotations in the news . Google Internet company that runs a dominant search engine and a major digital advertising network. Parent company is Alphabet.

Like many other Big Tech companies, Google is investing heavily in artificial intelligence . See the Artificial Intelligence chapter; Big Tech ; internet privacy . Google Cloud, Google Docs, Google Drive, Google Sheets But Google's cloud services . GPS Acceptable in all references to Global Positioning System . If a descriptive word is used following, use it in lowercase: the GPS satellite . hacker, hacktivism, hacktivist The term hacker is commonly used for someone who penetrates computer systems without authorization. The term originally referred to anyone with expertise in programming or hardware who tinkers with technology to understand its workings and explore new uses. Hacktivism consists of using computer skills as a form of protest or to try to effect change, typically in service of a cause or to expose perceived injustice. It can include defacing websites, launching denial-of-service attacks or hacking into networks and publicly leaking information. Explain the term if writing for a general audience. Hacktivists are individuals with computer skills primarily driven by political or social motives rather than personal gain. They use their skills to advance a cause or expose perceived injustice. Explain the term if writing for a general audience. While early hacktivists claimed and generally had altruistic goals, shadowy actors serving the interests of nation-states and other political forces have in more recent years conducted operations under the banner of \"hacktivism\" that warp its definition. handle A self-selected, public-facing username on a social network. May be used interchangeably with username . hashtag A term starting with a number or hash sign (#) in a social network post. It conveys the subject of the post so that it can be easily found by users interested in that subject. For example, the hashtag #UNGA is commonly used for the annual meeting of the U.N. General Assembly. A hashtag needs to be an uninterrupted string of characters, with no spaces. The use of hashtags has evolved to also reflect a post's tone. For example, a user may add #sarcasm or #feelingstupid to help describe the nature of a post. When posting, take note that the use of a hashtag associated with a movement or cause could be interpreted as a sign of support. AP journalists should avoid this, unless the hashtag itself is the subject of the post. In stories, write the hashtag as it would appear on a social network: The #Jan25 hashtag was credited with spreading support for the Egyptian uprising in its early days. HDMI Acceptable on all references for High-Definition Multimedia Interface , a system of cables and connectors used to transmit and receive high-definition video. Commonly used to connect DVD players, digital video recorders and other video devices to television sets and computers.

In video playback: A display feature that permits brighter whites and darker blacks. HDR can refer to television sets, tablets and other displays with the capability. Video adapted for HDR uses formats such as HDR10 and Dolby Vision . HDR displays and video also typically produce a wider range of colors, although that is technically not part of HDR . In photography: A camera feature that automatically blends multiple shots of the same subject taken at different exposures in order to prevent bright areas from being too bright and dark areas from being too dark. Some smartphones now have the feature on by default. hertz This term, the same in singular or plural, has been adopted as the international unit of frequency equal to one cycle per second.

IM Acceptable on second reference for instant message . Sometimes used as a verb: IM'ing, IM'd . An instant message is similar but not identical to a direct message ; both offer person-to-person communication, but instant messages are usually associated with apps such as Apple's iMessage whose primary purpose is to connect individuals or small groups. Direct messages are generally associated with broader communication platforms such as Facebook. Instagram Photo- and video-sharing service owned by Meta Platforms . internet A decentralized worldwide network of computers and other devices that undergirds global communications. An outgrowth of a 1960s Pentagon project, the internet blossomed as computers grew cheaper and smaller while the World Wide Web made communication simpler and more visual. The web , like email , is a service of the internet . The terms are not synonymous and should not be used interchangeably. See the Social Media Reporting chapter; misinformation, fact checks, fake news . Internet of Things General term used to describe devices, appliances, sensors and other gadgets with internet connections. This somewhat obscure term should be avoided in stories for general readers. Instead, use internet-connected or smart , such as internet-connected thermostat or smart light bulb . See smart devices . internet privacy A major issue for Big Tech companies and their users, particularly as governments begin cracking down on how corporations can use the personal information their users provide as part of their online activities. Companies such as Google and Facebook have long vacuumed up the personal information users share online — often unknowingly — in order to better target digital ads or predict buying behavior. Awareness of these tactics rose substantially in 2018 when Facebook acknowledged that a political consulting firm, Cambridge Analytica, had mined data on millions of users through a Facebook app that purported to be a psychological research tool. Technologies such as browser cookies and mobile device IDs can follow individual users as they move across websites and use different apps. Data collected online and in the physical world via personal devices ranging from fitness trackers to smart home appliances can include users' physical locations, recreational pursuits, home schedules, shopping and dietary habits, favorite sports teams and celebrities, vacation destinations, publications read, and television shows watched. Companies can also infer race or political views based on the types of sites visited online. Proponents of data collection and targeted advertising say the practice makes ads more relevant to users and cheaper for advertisers. But governments, particularly in the European Union and U.S. states such as California, have since passed measures that limit how companies collect and share such data. For instance, websites now commonly ask users for permission before saving their personal information in data cookies, a practice that once occurred behind the scenes. See opt in, opt out . Companies often say they don't sell data to third parties, a misleading statement that obscures the fact that they often make it available to advertising partners for free when users click their ads. Companies also frequently do in-house targeting on behalf of customers, allowing them to make money off user data without any need to sell it. See digital advertising, internet advertising, online advertising . internet privacy laws The United States has a patchwork of federal and state laws that cover different segments of data privacy, like health data, financial information or protections for children. But there's no single, comprehensive federal law regulating how companies collect, store or share consumer data. Data protections in the United States are notably different than in the European Union, which has a comprehensive data privacy law — the General Data Protection Regulation, a set of strict data privacy rules for citizens of the EU that took effect in 2018. See GDPR . internet security As many aspects of daily life and business have moved online, so have thieves, vandals and spies. Keeping organizations, individuals and their data protected online is an increasingly challenging task that has acquired a specialized vocabulary. Some terms: encryption The mathematical scrambling of messages in order to shield them from unauthorized viewing or modification. Such encrypted messages can typically be read only by the sender and the intended recipient, although in the case of commercial messaging systems, the service provider can often also decrypt and access messages and data such as files, photos or video. end-to-end encryption A way of encrypting messages such that only the sender and recipient can read them. The messaging service does not have the ability to read or modify such messages. That also means it cannot respond to requests from law enforcement; in response, government agencies have been pushing services to create backdoors just for them, though security experts warn that any backdoor for governments could also be exploited by criminals and other parties. Services that offer end-to-end encryption include Signal , Apple's iMessage and Meta Platforms' WhatsApp and Messenger . No encryption method is foolproof, and advances in computing power and cryptographic methods can often unlock messages encrypted by older technologies. Hackers can also sometimes exploit undiscovered bugs in encryption software to illicitly read supposedly secure messages or files. Attackers often break into seemingly secure systems by exploiting vulnerabilities – software or hardware flaws that can be used to bypass security protections. A zero-day vulnerability is such a flaw that has gone undetected by the system's creators and security reviews; explain this term when used in stories for general audiences. malware A general term for software that takes harmful or surreptitious actions, usually to steal data or money, access secure systems, or disrupt organizations. Malware can spread via phishing , \"poisoned\" websites that resemble familiar destinations, apps, or by exploiting vulnerabilities in computer systems. phishing Exploits the trust of users to attack computer systems or to commit fraud by stealing personal information such as credit card numbers, Social Security numbers, user IDs and passwords. The technique typically involves doctored emails often apparently sent by friends, family or co-workers that contain attachments or links to sites that infect a user's computer with malware. spyware Designed to ransack personal information, track the online activity of individuals, and sometimes to conduct surveillance via device microphones and cameras. ransomware Essentially holds a target computer or computer system hostage by encrypting its files and demanding payment, often via bitcoin. Ransomware can target individuals, businesses and governments alike. denial-of-service attack Entails targeting an internet site with enormous volumes of spurious data traffic. When successful, such attacks can knock a site or service offline until their operators find a way to divert the traffic elsewhere. Sometimes abbreviated DoS , although this shorthand is best avoided. A distributed denial-of-service attack , sometimes abbreviated DDoS , employs a network of distributed computers to direct junk traffic at the target site. botnet A collection of computers infected with malware that can be centrally controlled to conduct cyberattacks. Botnets have been used to carry out denial-of-service attacks, spread malware , send spam and steal data. Botnets can include a variety of devices, from desktop PCs to servers to household smart devices such as internet-connected video cameras. See cyberattack . internet service provider ISP is acceptable on second reference. intranet A private network inside a company or organization intended for internal use. IP address Short for Internet Protocol address , a numeric address given to a computer connected to the internet. Most users never see IP addresses ; instead they type in domain names such as apnews.com as stand-ins for the numeric address. Background domain name servers translate from IP addresses to text and back. IP addresses can sometimes be used to identify the location of a computer, the company or organization it belongs to, and where it was registered. Avoid the term in most stories. If necessary, IP address is acceptable on first reference with explanation, such as: Hackers targeted the site's IP address, a numeric designation that identifies its location on the internet. See domain name . IT Abbreviation for information technology . For general audiences, use IT only on second reference. For more technically oriented audiences, IT is acceptable on all references.

Unlike traditional light bulbs, LEDs produce light in one direction and are generally much more energy-efficient. LED is acceptable on first reference. lidar (n., adj.) Short for light detection and ranging , lidar is a sensing method that uses pulses of laser light to determine the presence, shape and distance of objects, often in great detail. Many autonomous vehicles – excepting those made by Tesla – use lidar for guidance; the technology also has many research applications, particularly in generating precise three-dimensional renderings of Earth's surface. It can detect objects in darkness and at times in bad weather. The term is acceptable on first reference with explanation. As an adjective: lidar sensors or lidar lasers .

Meta Platforms The company formerly known as Facebook, renamed in October 2021 to emphasize Mark Zuckerberg's new goal of building the metaverse . Meta is acceptable on first reference, but use the full name somewhere in the story. Describe it as the parent company of Facebook if the context isn't clear. The company also owns Instagram , a photo- and video-sharing service; the WhatsApp messaging service; and Messenger . Meta calls this collection of businesses Family of Apps . Its other business segment, Reality Labs , includes virtual and augmented reality hardware and software such as the Oculus VR headset. See Facebook (social platform) ; metaverse . metaverse A term minted by the science fiction writer Neal Stephenson in his 1992 novel \"Snow Crash,\" now used to describe a proposed immersive version of the internet accessed via virtual reality headsets, augmented reality glasses, phone apps or other devices. Think of the metaverse as the internet brought to life, or at least rendered in 3D. Facebook co-founder Mark Zuckerberg has been a major metaverse proponent, even renaming Facebook the company to Meta Platforms in 2021, although Meta's early metaverse offerings have not proven popular. See Meta Platforms . Microsoft A software and internet services company historically best known for its Windows operating system and Office productivity software. Microsoft also runs one of the world's largest cloud computing operations under the name Azure and holds a major footprint in video games thanks to its Xbox family of gaming consoles. The company has also taken a significant step into artificial intelligence by incorporating an AI chatbot based on the GPT technology developed by OpenAI into its search engine, Bing . See the Artificial Intelligence chapter. microtargeting The practice of targeting ads to small groups of people, sometimes even individuals, based on data collected by advertisers and internet companies like Meta Platforms and Google. mips Acronym for million instructions per second . Spell out on first reference. mobile payment Typically refers to a payment for goods or services made by tapping a phone or smartwatch near a card reader at a physical retail store or business. A form of payment previously provided to a mobile payment service, usually a credit or debit card, gets charged. Not all card readers and businesses accept mobile payments, although the number is growing. Apple Pay and Google Pay are among the major services. Although these services are typically used for in-person payments, some also offer web and app payment options. Such services often use a substitute card number on the phone or watch to increase security. While a customer's regular card account gets charged for transactions, hackers who steal the substitute number cannot use it without also having the device present to verify the transaction. In a broader sense, mobile payments can also refer to sending money to friends or family through an app using a payment service such as Venmo . In some developing countries, where credit cards and bank accounts aren't as widespread, mobile payments can refer to the use of text messaging and other means to transfer money or buy goods and services. See digital wallet, mobile wallet . net neutrality The idea that internet service providers shouldn't favor or discriminate against some websites or services over others. Internet service providers such as phone and cable companies typically oppose net neutrality regulations. Office Software package made by Microsoft.

The company has also extended Office to include such collaborative tools as SharePoint and Teams and the cloud-storage service OneDrive . Microsoft now prefers to sell Office via an online subscription called Office 365 . offline, online OpenAI An artificial intelligence company best known for developing ChatGPT and the AI large language models on which the chatbot is based. OpenAI started as a nonprofit in 2015 with a mission to advance AI in a way that benefits humanity. It later incorporated a for-profit arm and shifted most of its workforce to that business, but retained a nonprofit board of directors that governed the privately held company. OpenAI's unusual structure and shift from nonprofit to big business contributed to the temporary ouster of CEO Sam Altman in late 2023 and led a former financial backer and board member, Elon Musk, to sue the company in 2024. OpenAI has close ties to Microsoft, which has invested billions of dollars in the company and has rights to use its AI models. ChatGPT's products include its GPT language models and DALL-E image generator. See the Artificial Intelligence chapter. opt in, opt out (v.), opt-in, opt-out (adj.) Terms used to describe how a service obtains permission for collecting and sharing data. The opt-in option requires explicit permission, while the opt-out approach typically assumes permission unless someone takes a proactive step to withdraw consent. When writing about opt-in permission, specify how a service defines such permission whenever possible. For instance, a company with an opt-in approach may request users to accept a lengthy document that isn't prominent or easy to understand, which users are more likely to simply accept than to read through. Be mindful that while a company may promise to allow users to opt out of a practice, the consumer must know that the practice exists and how to opt out of it. See internet privacy .

AMA is acceptable on second reference. robot, robotics A robot is a mechanical device that typically can move and perform actions on its own using motors, sensors and computing. Examples include robotic arms used in factories or autonomous wheeled vacuum cleaners. Some robots are mostly remote-controlled, such as those used in surgery. A humanoid is a robot that physically resembles a person, though it's still uncommon outside science fiction and research labs. Avoid calling something a robot if it is more like a remote-controlled puppet. Artificial intelligence software can be a component of a robot , but avoid calling something a robot or robotic if it is entirely software-based, such as automated systems used in online conversation or to help make decisions. However, the term bot can be used to describe such software-based systems. A chatbot is a bot that can engage in conversations with people. Robotics is the study and development of robots and similar machines such as drones and self-driving cars. See the Artificial Intelligence chapter.

Messaging services such as WhatsApp and Signal are often lumped with social media but are not technically social media services. But the line has blurred in recent years, as chat services such as Apple's iMessage, WeChat from the Chinese company Tencent and the Japan-based Line take on broader functions such as payments and group sharing.

{"source_url": "https://www.apstylebook.com/ap_stylebook/mergers-and-acquisitions", "entry_header": "Mergers and Acquisitions", "text_content": "Is it a merger or a takeover? Few business combinations are truly a merger of equals, so we need to be precise and sparing in the use of the word \"merger.\" It is not a synonym for an acquisition or takeover , which should be the preferred descriptive used in most of our stories. But how do we first decide whether or not it's a merger, and if the answer is not, what are the rules that should guide us in concluding who's buying whom? The AP M&A Checklist: 1. Is one of the companies' stock being used as the currency? If the answer is yes, that's usually a good sign that company is the acquirer and it is not a merger. 2. What is the message from the exchange ratio in stock transactions? Typically when shareholders of Company A are offered new shares in a combined company at a 1-for-1 ratio, and Company B shares are exchanged at something less or more (i.e., each Company B share will be exchanged for 0.47% of a share of the new company), it's an indication that Company A's stock is being used as the basis for the transaction. But it also could be a sign that the companies' boards have agreed to a merger that uses a formula to compensate for the differing market value (total number of shares multiplied by the closing stock price the day before the announcement) of the two companies to come up with an exchange ratio for stock in the new company. 3. What is the message from the stock movements after the announcement? Shares of companies being acquired typically rise and shares of the acquirer often fall after the announcement. Not always, of course, but that's usually the case because most bidders pay a premium , or an above-market price, for the shares of the company being acquired, and investors often are worried about the amount of debt the acquirer is taking on to complete the transaction. 4. Whose cash is being used to fund the cash portion of a transaction? If the announcement says Company A's cash will be used or that its existing lines of credit will be tapped to pay for Company B's shares, that's a pretty strong indication that Company A is the acquirer. 5. Which company's executives are filling most of the top management roles? The key distinction usually is who gets the CEO slot. But if one of the two CEOs is named to head the company for a limited period (say two years or less) before his fellow CEO takes over, that's a good sign of a political compromise to paper over the fact that the second CEO's company is going to be in charge long-term. 6. Which company will end up with the majority of the seats on the new board of directors? This is often a key tiebreaker. It's a good indication of which outfit is going to be in charge if one ends up with 60% of the board and the other gets 40%. Also, make sure to get not only the short-term makeup of the board of the combined company, but also whether there were any deals cut for some members to retire in short order. 7. Whose name will be on the big sign outside the headquarters? Usually an obvious tell, but not always. First Union clearly was the acquirer of Wachovia, but the board members decided for their own reasons to use the Wachovia name when the two North Carolina banks combined operations. It may have been a deal killer for some Wachovia board members if their name didn't survive, or it may have simply been a marketing decision by First Union's brass that the name Wachovia had a better chance of standing out in the crowded banking space. Wachovia, incidentally, was acquired by Wells Fargo in 2008. 8. Where will the company be headquartered? Since CEOs typically do the negotiating and they typically aren't anxious to move, this can be an informative tell. How to value the transaction Our basic rule is to exclude the debt of the acquired company when calculating the value of a takeover. If Company A has agreed to pay $50 a share in cash for all of the stock of Company B, you would multiply $50 times the fully diluted number of shares outstanding of Company B to come up with transaction's total value. Companies often include the debt in their news release, which places a higher total value on the transaction. In cases like that, if they spell out the debt total, back it out and fashion a lead something like this: Company A, the world's largest TK, agreed Monday to pay $XX million to acquire Company B, whose product line XXX will do XXXX. The transaction, valued at $50 per share, or a X.X premium to Friday's closing price, includes the assumption of $XXX million of Company B's debt. Unfortunately, news releases sometimes only provide the per-share number for the transaction. So in addition to calling the company to get the key numbers we need to value the transaction, we should backstop by reviewing the latest 10-Q filing of the acquired company to get the number of fully diluted shares outstanding so we can do the math ourselves. In some cases, companies only give the per-share number because they don't want to call attention to the fact that there are an enormous number of options of the acquired company that can be exercised as part of a transaction. When stock is the currency used in the transaction, or is part of a stock and cash offer, the valuation equation changes. If Company A offers 1 share of its stock for each share of Company B, you would multiply the previous day's closing price of Company A by the number of fully diluted shares outstanding of Company B. When there is a cash component per share, or if the exchange ratio is greater or lesser than 1-for-1, the math gets a little more complicated, but it's also straightforward. First calculate the value of the stock portion (If Company A is offering 0.47 of a share of its stock that was trading at $50 yesterday, the stock portion is worth 50 x .47, or $23.50.) Then add whatever will be paid in cash per share (say $10) to give a total value of $33.50 per Company B share and multiply that times the total number of shares of Company B outstanding. Any time stock of the acquirer is used as a currency in a takeover, the value of the transaction obviously can change throughout the day based on the stock movement of the acquirer. But for our purposes, on the day the takeover is announced, we should stay with our initial valuation (based on the closing price of the acquirer a day earlier) until the markets close. Then we should redo the math based on that day's closing value of the acquirer's stock – and make it clear to readers why the total has changed from what they have been reading throughout the day. What needs to be in the first version of the story Lead with the full name of the buyer and include a descriptive size and scope, explain the terms and value of the deal as simply as possible (all cash? cash and stock? all stock?) while adding the name of the company to be acquired, and provide a reason why the deal is happening – or, if the release is mum on that point, a description of what the combined company will look like or the capabilities it will have (making it the world's biggest maker of fish tacos). If there are job cuts or other major corporate developments, including a warning that future earnings will be lower because of earnings dilution , aim to get those in the initial story. Dilution occurs when a stock-based transaction increases the number of shares of the acquirer without a near-term corresponding increase in earnings per share. Specify where the two companies are headquartered . Also include stock price history and premarket trading , if it is available, for both the acquirer and the acquiree. And if it is easily obtainable, specify what the premium that the acquiring company is offering and whether it is a hostile bid . As the urgent series continues, include any pertinent details about potential antitrust issues, contingencies like the need for board approval, government approval, shareholder approval, court approval, break-up fees, due diligence (the review by the acquirer of a target company's internal books and operations), and nondisclosure/confidentiality agreements . Also specify the stage of the transaction – letter of intent, definitive agreement, closing, etc. And if not added already, provide details about how the acquirer will finance the takeover, what the seller's plans are for the proceeds it will be receiving, the projected effect on future sales/earnings, other details on how the companies will change as a result of the deal (layoffs, management changes, etc.), and when the deal is expected to close. Add historical perspective. A news story showed a good example: In early 2003, Overture bought Altavista from CMGI for $140 million in cash and stock. That didn't look like much of a deal until they added the needed perspective that CMGI bought Altavista from Compaq only four years earlier for $2.3 billion. What is the stock reaction telling us? If Company A offers $50 in cash for Company B and the share price of Company B rises to $55 or $60, that's a pretty strong indication that some investors are betting at least one competing bid will emerge. Alternatively, if Company B's shares trade way below $50, we need to find out why investors are skittish about the deal closing. It also should be standard practice to keep track of the stock prices of both the acquirer and the target in the days and weeks after the initial announcement. Depending on how they perform, you may want to write additional stories about whether investors are betting the deal is on track or in trouble. And when stock is used as part or all of the currency for a proposed takeover, it's a good idea to build the formula into a spreadsheet and track it daily to see whether the spread between the market price is narrowing or widening from the offer's valuation. Some investors make and lose millions on these bets, so be careful when you interview them about these deals – and make sure to explain what they have at stake if we quote them either speaking in support of or objecting to the transaction. Assessing the deal's chances for success Besides the market implications about whether a deal will close or not, we should also from the first day be sharpening our analysis about whether the proposal makes business sense. There are several ways to approach this. Are the promised cost cuts doable, and what will they cost in human terms (jobs lost) and the effects on local economies? Will it deliver the higher profits the acquirer is promising? Will it position the acquirer's stock for future market gains? We should be asking these questions as part of our first-day coverage and come back as often as needed for deals both pending and completed."}
{"source_url": "https://www.apstylebook.com/ap_stylebook/business-guidelines", "entry_header": "Business Guidelines", "text_content": "Our market is the individual consumer of business news. We must write in a lively, clear and accessible style that provides explanation and content for people who may not have a deep knowledge of business and finance. We must avoid insider jargon and present complex issues in an understandable, straightforward manner. No story is too small or routine to meet this standard: Each has meaning for readers and viewers. They may own a stock we are writing about, live in a community where a company is based, use a product or service or have some other connection to the news we are providing. We must keep in mind that we are writing on a global scale and make sure that our reporting reflects that and think about creative ways to tell stories. AP business journalists must be careful with numbers; quickly grasp what those numbers mean and turn those numbers into real stories, not just about companies or profits but about people's lives. When stories break, or when you set out to break a story yourself, you need experts or insiders who can help. And you need to know where you can find all the facts you need: in SEC filings, court documents, lists of shareholders and creditors, company histories, etc. COVERING CORPORATE EARNINGS REPORTS U.S. federal law requires corporations whose stock is publicly traded to report revenue and profit or losses every three months. This is what business is all about, whether a corporation made money or lost it, and why. These statements are usually released on the major public relations wire services during earnings season, a three- or four-week period that begins roughly two weeks after the end of each quarter. Before each quarterly reporting period begins, AP business editors and reporters determine which companies will receive expanded coverage based on reader interest, corporate developments, legal or regulatory issues, and influence on financial markets and consumers. When these companies report earnings, AP typically will publish a several-hundred word report and, in some cases, additional elements such as video and graphics. The AP automates the writing of thousands of quarterly earnings stories using software. These stories average about 200 words and provide customers with the basics: the net income and revenue that the company reported for the quarter -- and year -- when applicable. An algorithm that creates the stories also is designed to report if the company beat the expectations of Wall Street analysts that cover the company and to include forward-looking guidance when that information is available. The standard style for slugs is BC-US--Earns-Company Name. While AP is automating many earnings reports, there are times when reporters can and should write original earnings stories or add to automated earnings reports. The decision to add original reporting depends on many factors including the stock activity following an earnings announcement. Many of the following principles should be followed whether a reporter writes an earnings story from the beginning or adds to one that was automatically generated. — We should tell the reader what the company does and give the increase or decline of net income either in percentage or absolute terms, along with the reason. Net income is synonymous with profit or earnings. The story should also include the company's revenue, which is sometimes called sales. In AP copy, however, this should always be referred to as revenue. — Comparisons of profits or losses and revenues/sales should be made with the same period a year earlier, expressed both as a total and as earnings per share, which is simply the profit divided by the number of shares of stock outstanding. Company statements sometimes express this figure as fully diluted. Many company statements also include basic earnings per share, but AP uses fully diluted as a more meaningful figure. — Use active verbs – rose, fell and the like – not passive constructions like were up/down . And to calculate the percentage change in profit, use the year-over-year change in net income, not the earnings-per-share numbers. The number of shares outstanding can, and often does, change year to year, which doesn't make it a clear apples-to-apples comparison. — Include comments on the corporation's performance from the chief executive or outside analysts, and any background that puts the performance in perspective. — Be alert to announcements of job cuts, executive resignations, acquisitions, changes in strategy, data about key products, warnings of a reduction of future earnings or upward revisions of earnings forecasts. Why net income is important Net income truly is the bottom line and the benchmark for companies' performance over time. It's what they are required to report to the SEC in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and it gives us a standard reporting format that brings a consistency to our news report. In the rare cases where companies don't provide the net income number in their news release, we need to press their representatives for those numbers. And if they are not immediately available, we need to be as transparent as possible in explaining to readers why we are providing pro forma or some other adjusted or non-GAAP representation of the company's results instead of the net income figures, which were not disclosed. Wall Street analysts have been much more concerned in recent years with operating earnings per share, which are calculated by excluding one-time extraordinary gains or charges, and revenue totals. Operating earnings may exclude the costs of a big reorganization, such as severance payments to laid-off workers or penalties for breaking leases on factories that are closed. If a company has no extraordinary events, operating earnings and net earnings can be identical. In the days and weeks before earnings reports, analysts issue EPS predictions, and these predictions are compiled into a consensus figure by research companies such as FactSet and Zacks Investment Research. On the day of the report, investors compare the consensus prediction for operating earnings per share with the actual number and the stock price often moves up or down based on whether the company falls short of, meets or exceeds expectations. When AP says in a story \"Company X's performance beat Wall Street analysts' predictions,\" this is the number we're referring to. In most stories we explain how the adjusted number was calculated and immediately compare the adjusted earnings per share to the consensus, or average, analyst forecast. It's worth noting that the analysts' forecast for earnings and revenue in a quarter often reflects the guidance provided by companies about what they expect their earnings and sales will be. That's why it's important to not only review what the analysts' consensus forecast is, but to determine whether a company has made a public forecast. When earnings or revenue disappoint, it's a much more powerful statement for us to say the company's earnings fell short of its own forecast, as well as analysts' expectations – assuming those facts are obtainable. Operating earnings is sometimes confused with earnings from continuing operations . Continuing operations is a subset of operations. It refers to business units that existed in the past and will exist in the future. It excludes discontinued operations which represent businesses that have been sold or shut down in the past year. Companies often downplay earnings of these operations since they are no longer relevant to future profits. Importance of the conference call Stocks often move within seconds of an unexpected pronouncement by the CEO or CFO on the analyst conference call after the earnings are released. It could come from their response to a question about a big contract, the reason for a revised sales or earnings forecast, or any number of other reasons. That's information we obviously will want in a quick writethru of the story. But even if there are no dramatic announcements, it's important to listen to the call to gain a more complete understanding of how the company is positioning itself going forward. And it may provide a colorful key quote from a top company executive. Make the company come to life Earnings are the report cards for top corporate executives. The results, more often than not, are a consequence of decisions they made – acquisitions they engineered, factories they convinced their boards of directors to build or shutter, advertising campaigns they approved. Including detail about the decisions corporate executives have made helps us show that companies are made up of people who win or lose based on the decisions they make. How to assemble a wrap story When two or more companies in the same industry report earnings on the same day, we often want an earnings wrap story after the separate earnings stories are out and updated with details from the conference calls. These should read like a seamless narrative with one or more thematic elements holding them together. And in almost every case, a wrap should have a forward-looking element that gives readers a sense of whether the good or bad earnings are likely to get better or worse in future quarters, and why. The basis for the thematic element may come from one or more of the conference calls that company executives hold after releasing earnings. Or there may be cases where your reporting will take you in a different direction in identifying the unifying theme. Talk to money managers who own the stock, competitors and others who you think can provide insight into what is going on. There also may be cases where the earnings are so divergent that the theme could be that the industry appears to be in disarray. But in all cases, our aim should be to convey to readers who is winning, who is losing and why. That often means that the wrap story may have a more complete explanation of how specific decisions made by executives impacted the earnings. It also isn't necessary to repeat in the wrap version every number that is in the separate earnings stories. Instead, you should use a common sense approach that asks the question: Is this number necessary to convey the main points we are trying to make? They don't have to be lengthy expositions; if you can tell the tale in 400 or 500 words, all the better. INTERNATIONAL BUREAUS Currency Conversions Currency conversions are necessary in stories that use foreign currency to make clear for readers how a number translates into dollars. But conversions should be used sparingly and preferably not in the lead unless it's a significant part of a story. A conversion is generally needed only the first time a currency is mentioned. The reader can make the necessary conversions after that. Do not convert amounts that are not current because exchange rates change over time. If necessary for clarity in the story, specify that the conversion is at current exchange rates. When conversions are needed, use the $ sign to report U.S. dollar amounts and write euros in the form 100 euros . Do not use the euro symbol (€). Examples: AMSTERDAM (AP) – Anheuser-Busch InBev, the world's largest brewer, says its third-quarter profits rose as the takeover of new brands and higher selling prices offset the impact of lower sales volumes. The company, based in Leuven, Belgium, said Thursday that net profit was up 31 percent to $2.37 billion (1.73 billion euros), from $1.81 billion in the same period a year earlier. The gain largely reflects the company's $20 billion purchase in June of the 50% of Mexico's Grupo Modelo it didn't already own. PARIS (AP) – French cosmetics giant L'Oreal says sales of its Maybelline makeup, Garnier shampoo and other beauty aids helped lift earnings to a new record in 2013. The company behind Lancome cosmetics and the Body Shop retail chain reported net profit of 2.96 billion euros ($4 billion) last year, up 3.2% from 2.87 billion in 2012. For all other currencies, following the amount, spell out the name of the currency followed in parentheses by the equivalent in U.S. dollars. Japan approved a 1.8 trillion yen ($18 billion) extra budget to partially finance an economic stimulus package. When dealing with a dollar currency of a country other than the United States, use the following abbreviations before the amount on second and subsequent references: AU$ Australian dollars CA$ Canadian dollars SG$ Singapore dollars NZ$ New Zealand dollars HK$ Hong Kong dollars NT$ New Taiwan dollars ZW$ Zimbabwe dollars Treasurer Wayne Swan approved a 16 billion Australian dollar ($10.74 billion) deal. Swan said AU$8 billion would be reserved for capital expenditure. Different Accounting Rules In some countries, companies don't report every quarter. The reports may come out every six months or even annually. Many foreign companies don't report net income or earnings per share . Some report earnings before taxes . If that's all they report, call them to see if they will give you net income. If they won't, use whatever number seems closest. For the companies that report only half-year and full-year results, add a line saying, \"The company did not break out quarterly results,\" so it's clear why we're not using them. Similarly, when reporting sales results for French companies, note that they often report sales a week or two before profit. Foreign companies that sell shares in the United States (called American depositary receipts) often issue a separate earnings statement using American accounting standards. Use this when you can."}

{"source_url": "https://www.apstylebook.com/ap_stylebook/climate-change-climate-crisis", "entry_header": "climate change, climate crisis", "text_content": "Either term can be used in broad references to the general state of the climate: increasing extreme weather and rising average global temperatures, which both have big impacts on people around the world, while there is a steady rise in greenhouse gas emissions, the main driver of climate change. The terms often can be used interchangeably. But in general, use the term climate change when referring to long-term shifts in temperatures and weather patterns, and the science explaining or describing those shifts. These shifts have resulted in both slow-onset and extreme weather. Slow-onset changes include increasing temperatures; loss of biodiversity; land and forest degradation; desertification (the change of arable land into a desert); ocean acidification; sea level rise; and glacial retreat. Extreme weather includes heat waves, droughts, storms, and floods from heavy rain or rising seas. The term climate crisis , used by the United Nations and others, may be used when describing the current situation. But use the term sparingly, and provide specifics as much as possible. Climate change , resulting in the climate crisis , is largely caused by human activities that emit carbon dioxide, methane and other greenhouse gases into the atmosphere, according to the vast majority of peer-reviewed studies, science organizations and climate scientists. This happens from the burning of coal, oil and natural gas, and other activities. A report in February 2022 by the world’s top body of climate scientists gave an alarming assessment of where the world is headed if more isn’t done to decrease emissions. Already, more instances of extreme weather are happening across the globe, from longer, more intense and more frequent droughts and heat waves to devastating floods and wetter hurricanes, attributed at least in part to climate change. Avoid attributing single occurrences to climate change unless scientists have established a connection. At the same time, stories about individual events should make it clear that they occur in a larger context. For example: Scientists say that without specific study they cannot directly link a single weather event to climate change, but in general it’s responsible for more intense and more frequent extreme storms, droughts, floods and wildfires. The climate story goes beyond extreme weather and science. It also is about politics, human rights, inequality, international law, biodiversity, society and culture, and many other issues. Successful climate and environment stories show how the climate crisis is affecting many areas of life. As climate change becomes a larger factor in the daily lives of many people, effective and accurate writing about this far-reaching and sometimes complex topic becomes even more important. global warming Use the term global warming in referring to the increase of average temperature around the world. It is one aspect of climate change. Do not use this term as a synonym for climate change . Telling the climate story Avoid jargon. Use simplified terms and concepts to relay complex information. Identify the source for specific climate change data and for any detailed predictions of how climate change will affect Earth. Sources of information should be from credible and nonpartisan groups, organizations and entities. No matter the source, when writing about a study or climate projection, always get outside perspectives from other scientists. Avoid false balance — giving a platform to unfounded claims or unqualified sources in the guise of balancing a story by including all views. For example, coverage of a study describing effects of climate change need not seek “other side” comment that humans have no influence on the climate. Scientific studies Climate reports vary in focus and impact. Only studies from reputable scientific bodies that are independent are to be used. These studies include those from the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change; the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change; NASA; the World Meteorological Organization; National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration; and the European Union’s Copernicus Climate Change Service. When covering international studies or events, localize the issue so your readers can connect to it. See the Stylebook’s Health and Science chapter for more detail on handling scientific studies. More terms and concepts fossil fuels Coal, oil and methane, referred to as fossil because they are formed underground over millions of years. Use the specifics rather than the shorthand term fossil fuels when possible. greenhouse gases Greenhouse gas emissions are the main driver of climate change. They consist largely of carbon dioxide and methane. Do not use the abbreviation GHG. Two key greenhouse gases are carbon dioxide and methane . carbon dioxide Much of climate change comes from the extra carbon dioxide resulting from burning fossil fuels and biomass; land-use changes; industrial processes; and other human activities. Carbon dioxide is responsible for nearly two-thirds of the heat effect, and stays in the atmosphere for hundreds of years. The shorthand CO2 is acceptable on second reference. methane A powerful climate-warming gas that leaks from coal mines and from gas wells, pipelines and other parts of natural gas delivery systems; is released by livestock; is generated in landfills; and is produced by certain agricultural practices. It is the main constituent in natural gas . It lasts for decades in the atmosphere. To compare emissions and how much they are contributing to climate change, scientists convert amounts of other gases to the equivalent amount of carbon dioxide with the same global warming potential, known as carbon dioxide equivalent . When discussing emissions more broadly — not just carbon dioxide — use an all-encompassing term such as greenhouse gases, planet-warming gases or heat-trapping gases . If discussing a certain type of emissions or polluting activity, be more specific in terms of which gas is being emitted. carbon budget The amount of carbon dioxide, which when released into the atmosphere warms the planet, that can be emitted globally before the world will exceed the goal of limiting temperature rise thresholds set by the 2015 Paris Agreement. That 2015 agreement called for limiting warming to 2 Celsius at the top but ideally 1.5 C (3.6 degrees Fahrenheit or 2.7 degrees, respectively ). Then in 2018, upon further review, IPCC scientists said warming should be capped at 1.5 C to avoid the worst impacts of global warming. Today, most international climate goals are based on the 1.5 C limit. carbon capture Usually short for carbon capture utilization and storage . Refers to an effort to capture CO2 emissions that would otherwise escape into the air, most frequently at the stacks of power production facilities or other large industrial sites, and transport it for long-term storage, often underground. Many companies and nations include carbon capture as an essential part of their plans to reach net zero emissions. But so far, this is happening at scale in just a few places and is far from being a major climate solution. carbon footprint Just about every business, government entity, product and mode of transportation has a carbon footprint , or an amount of greenhouse gases (mostly carbon dioxide, but others as well) put into the atmosphere. These greenhouse gases mostly come from the consumption of coal, oil and methane. Organizers of a sporting event may say the event is “environmentally friendly” or “green.” But if they can’t give details about the event’s carbon footprint, be skeptical of the claim. An outdoor concert organizer may claim the event is “green” because cellphone charging stations are powered by solar panels. But solar power may just be a fraction of the total energy used by the event. Or the emissions avoided by using the solar panels (instead of electricity generated from fossil fuels) may pale in comparison to emissions from other aspects of the event, such as thousands of people driving in their cars. When a company claims to be net zero or have low emissions, reporters should ask about the scope of emissions. There are three types of emissions. Scope 1 is the type of greenhouse gas emissions a company makes directly, such as running furnaces or cars. Scope 2 is what a company is indirectly responsible for, such as what was needed to provide electricity or heating. Scope 3 is all encompassing for a company’s products — not just what the company created to make the products but also emissions spewed when the product is used. A prime example of this is carbon dioxide emissions from gasoline-powered cars. That represents Scope 3 emissions from oil companies. climate change deniers, climate change skeptics, climate change doubters Do not use terms like climate change deniers, climate change skeptics or climate change doubters . Be specific about an individual or group of people’s beliefs. For instance: people who do not agree with mainstream science that says the climate is changing . Or people who do not believe that human activity is responsible for the bulk of climate change . Or people who disagree with the severity of climate change projected by scientists . climate goals When referring to how a policy or action will impact climate goals, either negatively or positively, make sure to specify what goal or goals to which you’re referring. In 2015, countries at the United Nations climate conference signed the Paris Agreement, where they agreed to limit the average warming across the globe to “well below” 2 degrees Celsius (3.6 F) and pursue efforts to cap warming to 1.5 degrees (2.7 F) compared to preindustrial times. Countries are expected to show how they plan to help achieve these goals by submitting their commitments to emissions reductions to the U.N. every five years. These submissions are called Nationally Determined Contributions. When reporting on whether something is or is not in line with climate goals, always check whether this refers to the 1.5 C goal, the 2 C goal or national ambitions, and specify this in your reporting. climate target This refers to temperature limits, concentration levels or emissions reduction goals used toward the aim of avoiding dangerous impacts on humans and the planet. Other terms: adaptation The process of adjusting to the current effects of climate change and preparing for future effects. For example, building a sea wall to combat flooding from rising seas is a way that a city may adapt to climate change. baseline scenario This term refers to scenarios that are based on continuing with the current levels of emissions without mitigation policies or measures beyond those already in place or planned. blue carbon This refers to carbon dioxide captured by living organisms in coastal and marine ecosystems and stored within these systems. These include mangroves, salt marshes and seagrasses. Explain the term if used. community solar A form of solar — larger than residential rooftop but smaller than an industrial solar farm for people who lack access to their rooftops, or have rooftops that are shaded or otherwise unsuitable. Users may pay a monthly fee or own a share. desertification The process in which land becomes increasingly dry, with the amount and lushness of vegetation decreasing and eventually disappearing. Explain the term if you use it or quote someone using it. direct air capture The effort to extract climate-warming carbon dioxide directly out of the air. Current efforts are expensive and extremely small scale. equity When talking about climate change, equity is the principle of fairness in sharing the burden and is a basis for understanding how the effects and responses to climate change, including costs and benefits, are distributed in and by society in equal ways. energy transition The global shift away from fossil fuels to clean energy for electricity, industry and transport to reduce climate change. funding rounds Startup companies that offer climate solutions typically raise money in rounds as they ramp up, for example Series A, B and C . geothermal Usually refers to the use of the Earth’s heat to make steam that drives a turbine to make clean electricity. May also refer to using the heat without turning it into electricity, as with residential geothermal or district heating. greenwashing Advertising or claims by companies, countries or other organizations that aim to deceive the public to believe a certain product, policy or organization is environmentally friendly. The term can be used independently or in direct quotations if one organization is accusing another of greenwashing. Explain the term when used. high emitters When referring to how polluting a country or company is, it is sometimes helpful to look at those emissions in the context of how much the country or company emits into the atmosphere compared with others and for how long they have been polluting. As carbon dioxide stays in the atmosphere for hundreds of years, it is important to consider historical emissions in reporting. Per capita emissions are sometimes used when comparing the carbon footprints of nations, particularly high-emitting countries like the United States, China, India, Russia and others. hydrogen Believed by some to have a role in the clean energy transition because it can be burned, generating high heat without releasing carbon dioxide. However, two key questions that should be asked are: What is the source of the hydrogen? Most commercial hydrogen today is obtained from methane, a fossil fuel. And second, what kind of energy was used to separate hydrogen from other atoms? The only truly clean hydrogen is produced in a process that does not rely on fossil fuel and is powered by renewable energy. mitigation Human intervention to reduce emissions or enhance the sinks of greenhouse gases, efforts aimed at combating climate change. Indigenous knowledge This refers to the understandings, skills and philosophies developed by societies with long histories of interaction with their natural surroundings. For many Indigenous peoples, Indigenous knowledge informs decision-making about fundamental aspects of life, from day-to-day activities to long-term management of rivers, wildfires and other aspects of the environment. Indigenous knowledge, or knowledges (both singular and plural are used), is increasingly talked about as a tool to combat climate change, the idea being that Indigenous peoples sustainably managed their lands for thousands of years. Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change A United Nations group created in 1988 to evaluate and contribute to scientific study of climate change. IPCC is acceptable on second reference. lithium ion Currently the most common type of battery, both for electric vehicles and for grid storage, but comes with intrinsic restrictions. These limitations plus the mining of lithium and associated environmental concerns have prompted a race for alternative battery chemistries. livestock Domesticated animals and in particular cows release significant methane into the atmosphere via flatulence and belching. landfills Landfills are a significant source of global methane. It is produced especially in wet environments when organic material is buried and its carbon bonds with hydrogen from water under anaerobic conditions. loss and damage In international climate negotiations, the term is used to refer to the contention that developed nations, which have done the most historically to cause climate change, should compensate developing countries, which have contributed little to climate change but often bear the worst effects. Explain the term when used. If possible, provide details on the compensation being debated. net zero The term is used by countries and companies and refers to balancing greenhouse gas emissions to the point that the amount taken out of the atmosphere is equal to the amount emitted. When using the term, be specific about the goal. For example, by 2030 several American tech companies are aiming to make their operations net zero . Hyphenate when used as a modifier. Explain the term when used. phasedown, phaseout These terms come up frequently in negotiations over national goals for use of fossil fuels. Phasedown is understood to mean a gradual reduction in fossil fuel use. Phaseout means ending all use of fossil fuels by a specific time. small island developing states A distinct group of developing countries facing specific social, economic and environmental vulnerabilities. When using the term, explain it. Do not use the abbreviation SIDS . storage Refers to storing clean electricity from solar and wind power for use later when those sources are not available, avoiding the need to make electricity at those times from climate-harmful sources such as natural gas or coal. Efforts are underway to develop batteries and other methods that can store clean power for days at a time,sometimes called long-term storage. vulnerability The International Panel on Climate Change defines it as the propensity or predisposition to be adversely affected. Vulnerability encompasses a variety of concepts and elements including sensitivity or susceptibility to harm and lack of capacity to cope and adapt. weather event When possible, avoid this term and instead be specific if the reference is to a specific flood, landslide, mudslide, hurricane, etc."}

The church in 2018 began moving away from the widely recognized terms Mormon church and LDS church , and now prefers that its full name be used and that members be referred to as Latter-day Saints . Use the full name of the church on first references, with the church, church members, members of the faith preferred on second and later reference. When necessary for space or clarity or in quotations or proper names, Mormon, Mormons and Latter-day Saints are acceptable. The term Mormon is based on the church’s sacred Book of Mormon and remains in common use by members of the faith. When using the church’s full name, include a short explanation such as, the church, widely known as the Mormon church ... The church is based on revelations that Joseph Smith said were given to him by heavenly messengers beginning in the 1820s and codified through 1843. These constitute scripture alongside the Bible in the King James Version. The headquarters is in Salt Lake City, but millions of its members live outside the U.S. Church hierarchy is composed of men known as general authorities . Among them, the policymaking body is the First Presidency, made up of a president and two or more counselors. With the Quorum of the Twelve Apostles, it has final authority in all church matters. CLERGY: All worthy young men over the age of 12 are members of the priesthood though they are not called priests. They can be ordained elders after age 18, usually after graduating from high school and before serving as missionaries. They may later become high priests, or bishops. Formal titles include president (for members of the First Presidency), bishop (for members of the Presiding Bishopric and for local bishops) and elder (for other general authorities and church missionaries). Capitalize these formal titles before a name on first reference; use only the last name on second reference. The terms minister or the Rev. are not used. See religious titles . RELATED GROUPS: The term Mormon is not properly applied to the other Latter Day Saints churches that resulted from the splits after Smith’s death. This includes groups that call themselves “fundamentalist” and others that perpetuate Smith’s practice of polygamy, which the church renounced in 1890. One offshoot group is the Community of Christ, headquartered in Independence, Missouri. For many decades, it was called the Reorganized Church of Jesus Christ of Latter Day Saints (note the lack of a hyphen and the capitalized Day)."}

Use the algebraic notation in providing tabular summaries. In algebraic notation, the \"ranks\" are the horizontal rows of squares. The ranks take numbers, 1 to 8, beginning on white's side of the board. The \"files\" are the vertical rows of squares. They take letters, a through h, beginning on white's left. Thus, each square is identified by its file letter and rank number. In the starting position, white's queen knight stands on b1 , the queen on d1 , the king on e1 ; black's queen knight stands on b8 , the queen on d8 , the king on e8 , and so on. Other features of the system follow: –DESIGNATION OF PIECES: The major pieces are shown by a capital letter: K for king, Q for queen, R for rook, B for bishop and N for knight. No symbol is used for the pawn. –MOVES BY PIECES: Shown by the letter of the piece (except for the pawn) and the destination square. For instance, Bb5 means the bishop moves to square b5. –MOVES BY PAWNS: Pawn moves are designated only by the name of the destination square. Thus, e4 means the pawn on the e file moves to e4. –CASTLING: It is written as 0-0 for the kingside and 0-0-0 for the queenside. Kingside is the side of the board (right half from white's point of view, left half from black's), on which each player's king starts. The other half is queenside . –CAPTURES BY PIECES: A capture is recorded using an x after the letter for the capturing piece. For instance, if white's bishop captures the black pawn at the f6 square, it is written Bxf6 . –CAPTURES BY PAWNS: When a pawn captures a piece, the players name the file the pawn was on and the square where it made the capture. If white's pawn on a g file captured black's pawn on f6 square, the move would be gxf6 . If black's pawn on an f file captured white's, it would be fxg5 . –CHECK: Use plus sign. –AMBIGUITY: If more than one piece of the same type can move to a square, the rank number or file letter of the origination square is added. Thus, if a rook on d1 were to move to d4, but another rook also could move there, instead of Rd4 the move would be given as R1d4 . If there are black knights on c6 and e6, and the one on e6 moves to d4, the move is given as Ned4 . The form, taken from a 1993 championship match: Short Karpov (White) (Black) 1. e4 c5 2.

To convert to Fahrenheit, multiply a Celsius temperature by 9, divide by 5 and add 32 (25 x 9 equals 225, divided by 5 equals 45, plus 32 equals 77 degrees Fahrenheit). To convert a temperature difference from Celsius to Fahrenheit, multiply by 9 and divide by 5. A difference of 5 degrees C is a 9-degree F difference. When giving a Celsius temperature, use these forms: 40 degrees Celsius or 40 C (note the space and no period after the capital C ) if degrees and Celsius are clear from the context. See Fahrenheit and metric system ."}

But conversions should be used sparingly and preferably not in the lead unless it's a significant part of a story. A conversion is generally needed only the first time a currency is mentioned. The reader can make the necessary conversions after that. Do not convert amounts that are not current because exchange rates change over time. If necessary for clarity in the story, specify that the conversion is at current exchange rates. EXAMPLES: AMSTERDAM (AP) – Anheuser-Busch InBev, the world's largest brewer, says its third quarter profits rose as the takeover of new brands and higher selling prices offset the impact of lower sales volumes. The company, based in Leuven, Belgium, said Thursday that net profit was up 31% to $2.37 billion (1.73 billion euros), from $1.81 billion in the same period a year earlier. The gain largely reflects the company's $20 billion purchase in June of the 50% of Mexico's Grupo Modelo it didn't already own. PARIS (AP) – French cosmetics giant L'Oreal says sales of its Maybelline makeup, Garnier shampoo and other beauty aids helped lift earnings to a new record in 2013. The company behind Lancome cosmetics and the Body Shop retail chain reported net profit of 2.96 billion euros ($4 billion) last year, up 3.2% from 2.87 billion in 2012. For all other currencies, following the amount, spell out the name of the currency followed in parentheses by the equivalent in U.S. dollars. Japan approved a 1.8 trillion yen ($18 billion) extra budget to partially finance an economic stimulus package.

(When market forces, not the government, push a currency down, it is known as depreciation.) Suppose China devalues its currency, the yuan, against the U.S. dollar. To calculate the devaluation, you'd look at the value of 1 yuan to the U.S. dollar before the devaluation and the value afterward and calculate the percentage difference. Example: On Monday, 1 yuan is worth 16.1 cents (or $0.161). On Tuesday, the Chinese government devalues the currency and 1 yuan is equal to 15.8 cents ($0.158). That is a 1.9% devaluation – the yuan has dropped 1.9% against the U.S. dollar. Currencies are often reported the other way, showing how much $1 is worth in another currency. In the example above, $1 went from being worth 6.21 yuan to being worth 6.32 yuan. To find out what 1 yuan is worth – so you can show the yuan dropping, not the dollar rising – divide 1 by 6.21 and 6.32 respectively."}

Do not, for example, use a Washington dateline on a story written primarily from information that a news organization reported under a Washington dateline. Use the home city of the news organization instead. This rule does not preclude the use of a story with a dateline different from the home city of a news organization if it is from the general area served by the news organization. If a radio broadcast monitored in another city was the source of information, use the dateline of the city where the monitoring took place and mention the fact in the story. When a story has been assembled from sources in widely separated areas, or when a reporter gathered the material remotely, it is acceptable to use no dateline. Datelines should convey the spirit of the reporting; they are not restricted to cities and towns. Census-designated places, townships, parks, counties, or datelines such as ABOARD AIR FORCE ONE or ON THE MISSISSIPPI RIVER may be used if appropriate. But do not designate neighborhoods or other places within a better-known jurisdiction as the dateline. For instance, NEW YORK should be the dateline, not BROOKLYN or CENTRAL PARK. For bylined stories, a reporter must be reporting from the dateline on the story. When there are multiple bylines, at least one reporter must have been at the scene, and a note at the end of the story should explain the locations of all bylined reporters. If the story has no dateline, no note is needed at the end of the story explaining the reporters’ locations. The dateline for video or audio must be the location where the events depicted actually occurred. For voice work, the dateline must be the location from which the reporter is speaking; if that is not possible, the reporter should not use a dateline. If a reporter covers a story in one location but does a live report from a filing point in another location, the dateline is the filing point."}

Today it also is used as a noun, referring to a category of doctrinally conservative Protestants. They emphasize the need for a definite, adult commitment or conversion to faith in Christ and the duty of all believers to persuade others to accept Christ. Evangelicals make up some conservative denominations and are numerous in broader denominations. Evangelicals stress both doctrinal absolutes and vigorous efforts to win others to belief. The National Association of Evangelicals is an interdenominational, cooperative body of relatively small, conservative Protestant denominations. evangelism The word refers to activity directed outside the church fold to influence others to commit themselves to faith in Christ, to his work of serving others and to infuse his principles into society's conduct. Styles of evangelism vary from direct preaching appeals at large public meetings to practical deeds of carrying the name of Christ, indirectly conveying the same call to allegiance to him. The word evangelism is derived from the Greek evangelion , which means the gospel or good news of Christ's saving action on behalf of humanity. fundamentalist The word gained usage in an early-20th century fundamentalist-modernist controversy within Protestantism. In recent years, however, fundamentalist has to a large extent taken on pejorative connotations except when applied to groups that stress strict, literal interpretations of Scripture and separation from other Christians. In general, do not use fundamentalist unless a group applies the word to itself. neo-Pentecostal, charismatic These terms apply to a movement that has developed within mainline Protestant and Catholic denominations since the mid-20th century. It is distinguished by its emotional expressiveness, spontaneity in worship, speaking or praying in \"unknown tongues\" and healing. Participants often characterize themselves as \"spirit-filled\" Christians. Unlike the earlier Pentecostal movement, which led to separate denominations, this movement has swelled within major churches. Pentecostalism A movement that arose in the early 20th century and separated from historic Protestant denominations. It is distinguished by the belief in tangible manifestations of the Holy Spirit, often in demonstrative, emotional ways such as speaking in \"unknown tongues\" and healing. Pentecostal denominations include the Church of God in Christ, Assemblies of God, the Pentecostal Holiness Church, the United Pentecostal Church Inc. and the International Church of the Foursquare Gospel founded by Aimee Semple McPherson."}

Do not use physician-assisted suicide or medically assisted suicide for euthanasia . Be specific about what is involved in each case. Euthanasia , in this context, involves doctors or other health practitioners, under strict conditions, actively killing patients who meet certain criteria by giving them a lethal injection at their request. It is legal in several countries. Medically assisted suicide, physician-assisted suicide or physician-assisted death involves patients themselves taking a lethal drink or medication that has been prescribed by a doctor to patients who meet certain criteria. It is legal in several U.S. states and several countries. The criteria that patients must meet vary by jurisdiction. Canada allows nurse practitioners, not just doctors, to end patients' lives. Advocacy groups sometimes use terms such as death with dignity, dying with dignity, the right to die, aid in dying or medical assistance in dying , but AP doesn't use those phrases on their own. When referring to legislation whose name includes such phrases, say the law or proposal allows people under specified conditions to end their own lives or allows a doctor (or nurse, as legislation specifies) to administer an injection intended to kill them (whichever is applicable). Do not confuse legally sanctioned euthanasia of people with what some call mercy killings, which do not involve consent, or with the euthanasia of animals.

{"source_url": "https://www.apstylebook.com/ap_stylebook/earthquakes", "entry_header": "earthquakes", "text_content": "The best source for information on major earthquakes is the National Earthquake Information Center, operated by the U.S. Geological Survey, in Golden, Colorado. Earthquake magnitudes are measures of earthquake size calculated from ground motion recorded by seismometers. The Richter scale, named for Charles F. Richter, is no longer widely used. Magnitudes are usually reported simply as magnitude 6.7 (or 6.7 magnitude ), for example. Do not use hyphens when the magnitude is used as a modifier: a magnitude 6.7 quake , a 6.7 magnitude quake. In the first hours after a quake, earthquake size should be reported as a preliminary magnitude at a preliminary depth . The most commonly used measure is the moment magnitude , related to the area of the fault on which an earthquake occurs and the amount the ground slips. The magnitude scale used should be specified only when necessary. An example would be when two centers are reporting different magnitudes because they are using different scales. The various scales usually differ only slightly. When comparing quakes, every increase of one number means that the quake is 10 times bigger and releases 32 times more energy. For example, a magnitude 7 quake shakes 10 times as hard and is 32 times stronger than a magnitude 6 quake. To determine the difference in size and strength, use the U.S. Geological Survey’s calculator: https://earthquake.usgs.gov/education/calculator.php . Some indications of earthquake size: Magnitude 2.5 to 3: The smallest generally felt by people. Magnitude 4: Can cause moderate damage. Magnitude 5: Can cause considerable damage. Magnitude 6: Can cause severe damage. Magnitude 7: A major earthquake, capable of widespread, heavy damage. Magnitude 8: An earthquake capable of tremendous damage. Depth is a key factor in determining how damaging an earthquake will be. The closer to the surface an earthquake starts, the more ground shaking and potential damage it will cause, particularly in places without strict building codes.  Two different earthquakes of the same magnitude can result in vastly different damage and deaths depending on the depth. Quakes are divided into three categories: shallow, intermediate and deep. Shallow quakes are at depths of less than 70 km (43 miles) and are the ones that have broader damage. Intermediate quakes are between 70 km and 300 km in depth (43 miles to 186 miles). Deep quakes are deeper than 300 km (186 miles). The deadliest quake on record occurred in Shaanxi province of China on Jan. 23, 1556. It killed 830,000 people. Initial earthquake reports from seismic monitoring networks are usually generated automatically and should be confirmed if the reporter did not feel the tremor. Some reports result from system errors and will be deleted after review by a seismologist. A very large earthquake anywhere in the world may cause a seismic network to produce erroneous reports of one or more quakes in its monitoring area. The USGS' \"Did You Feel It\" webpages collect unvetted reports from the public. These may be useful in characterizing how widely a quake was felt but singular reports from distant locations should be confirmed. OTHER TERMS: The word temblor (not tremblor) is a synonym for earthquake . The word epicenter refers to the point on Earth's surface above the underground center, or focus, of an earthquake. Earthquake early warning systems do not predict earthquakes. When an earthquake begins they provide warning to distant locations where the shaking has not yet begun."}

{"source_url": "https://www.apstylebook.com/ap_stylebook/firearms-guns-assault-weapons-2", "entry_header": "firearms, guns, assault weapons", "text_content": "Assault weapon is a political term that is often used by state and federal lawmakers to refer to types of semiautomatic rifles with certain features. States with assault weapons bans have varying definitions, but they generally refer to semiautomatic firearms with features such as a detachable magazine, pistol grip, a folding or detachable stock, or a threaded barrel. The terms assault weapons or assault rifles may be used in headlines and in first reference in a story because that is how the group of firearms has become commonly known. But high in the story, give specifics. For example: certain semiautomatic rifles referred to as assault weapons , or certain semiautomatic rifles commonly called assault weapons . Be as specific as possible about the types of guns at issue in any given law or story. Use the terms AR- or AK-style rifles when accurate. AR stands for Armalite Rifle , a nod to the company that designed the first one. AR-style rifles , the most common being the AR-15 style, are now made by numerous companies. AK-style is a different type of rifle based on the design of Mikhail Kalashnikova, the original creator of the AK-47 . Do not refer to assault weapons bans as bans on semiautomatic weapons , which encompasses many modern firearms not classified as assault weapons. Avoid the terms military-style rifles or modern sporting rifles . When reporting on guns, do not automatically repeat terms used by authorities, witnesses or others. Witnesses will often misinterpret the sound of a rapidly fired gun or base a description on the look of the weapon. Instead, seek specific and detailed information from authorities, such as a gun’s make, model, caliber and magazine capacity. For example, Authorities said the shooter used a Smith & Wesson M&P15 rifle or Authorities said the man used an AR-style semiautomatic rifle with a 30-round magazine . Use more generalized descriptions, such as rifle or handgun , until such details become available. Under federal law, automatic rifles are restricted in the United States to their manufacturers; licensed dealers; the military; law enforcement; and civilians who have special permission to own such weapons, provided that the weapons were imported or domestically manufactured before May 19, 1986. Other terms: anti-aircraft A cannon or other weapon designed for defense against air attack. The form: a 105 mm anti-aircraft gun . artillery A carriage-mounted cannon. automatic A firearm that reloads automatically after each shot. The term should not be used to describe the rate of fire. To avoid confusion, specify fully automatic or semiautomatic rather than simply automatic. Give the type of weapon or model for clarity. bolt-action rifle A manually operated handle on the barrel opens and closes the breech, ejecting a spent round, loading another and cocking the weapon for triggering. Popular for hunting and target-shooting. Example: Remington 700 . Some shotguns are bolt-action. buckshot See shot . bullet The projectile fired by a rifle, pistol or machine gun. Together with metal casing, primer and propellant, it forms a cartridge . caliber A measurement of the diameter of the inside of a gun barrel except for most shotguns. Measurement is in either millimeters or decimal fractions of an inch. The word caliber is not used when giving the metric measurement. The forms: a 9 mm pistol, a .22-caliber rifle . cannon A weapon, usually supported on some type of carriage, that fires explosive projectiles. The form: a 105 mm cannon . Plural is cannons . carbine A short, lightweight rifle, usually having a barrel length of less than 20 inches. The form: an M3 carbine . cartridge See bullet . clip Do not use this term unless in a quote. The correct term is magazine to describe the device used to store multiple rounds of ammunition together as a unit, ready for insertion into a firearm. A clip is a device that stores rounds together that can then be used to load bullets into a magazine . See magazine for a fuller description. Colt Named for Samuel Colt, it designates a make of weapon or ammunition developed for Colt handguns. The forms: a Colt .45-caliber revolver, .45 Colt ammunition . fully automatic A firearm that fires continuously as long as the trigger is depressed. Examples include machine guns and submachine guns . gauge The measure of the size of a shotgun. Gauge is expressed in terms of the number per pound of round lead balls with a diameter equal to the size of the barrel. The bigger the number, the smaller the shotgun. The forms: a 12-gauge shotgun, a .410 shotgun . The .410 actually is a caliber, but commonly is called a gauge. The ball leaving the barrel is 0.41” in diameter. ghost guns Privately made firearms that lack serial numbers used to trace them and are often purchased without a background check. Law enforcement officials have reported ghost guns have increasingly been used in violent crimes across the U.S. Avoid describing them as untraceable guns and instead say they are harder for law enforcement to trace. handgun A pistol or a revolver . howitzer A cannon shorter than a gun of the same caliber employed to fire projectiles at relatively high angles at a target, such as opposing forces behind a ridge. The form: a 105 mm howitzer . lever-action rifle A handle on the stock ejects and loads cartridges and cocks the rifle for triggering. A firearm often associated with the Old West. Example: Winchester 94 . M1, M16 These and similar combinations of a letter and figure(s) designate rifles used by the military. The forms: an M1 rifle, an M16 rifle . machine gun A fully automatic gun that fires as long as the trigger is depressed and bullets are chambered. Such a weapon is generally so large and heavy that it rests on the ground or a mount. A submachine gun is hand-held. The form: a .50-caliber Browning machine gun . magazine The ammunition storage and feeding device within or attached to a firearm. It may be fixed to the firearm or detachable. It is not a clip . Magnum A trademark for a type of high-powered cartridge with a larger case and a larger powder charge than other cartridges of approximately the same caliber. The form: a .357 Magnum, a .44 Magnum . mortar Device used to launch a mortar shell; it is the shell, not the mortar, that is fired. musket A heavy, large-caliber shoulder firearm fired by means of a matchlock, a wheel lock, a flintlock or a percussion lock. Its ammunition is a musket ball. pistol A handgun that can be a single-shot or a semiautomatic. Differs from a revolver in that the chamber and barrel are one integral part. Its size is measured in calibers. The form: a .45-caliber pistol . revolver A handgun. Differs from a pistol in that cartridges are held in chambers in a cylinder that revolves through the barrel. The form: a .45-caliber revolver . rifle A firearm designed or made to be fired from the shoulder and having a rifled bore. It uses bullets or cartridges for ammunition. Its size is measured in calibers. The form: a .22-caliber rifle . Saturday night special A compact, relatively inexpensive handgun. semiautomatic A firearm that fires only once for each pull of the trigger. It reloads after each shot. The form: a semiautomatic rifle, a semiautomatic weapon, a semiautomatic pistol . shell The word applies to military or naval ammunition and to shotgun ammunition. For small arms, bullet or round is the common term for ammunition. shot Small lead or steel pellets fired by shotguns. A shotgun shell usually contains 1 to 2 ounces of shot. Do not use shot interchangeably with buckshot , which refers only to the largest shot sizes. shotgun A firearm typically used to fire small spherical pellets called shot. Shotguns usually have a smooth bore barrel, but some contain a rifled barrel, which is used to fire a single projectile. Size is measured according to gauge, except for the .410, which is measured according to caliber, meaning the ball leaving the barrel is 0.41” in diameter. The form: a 12-gauge shotgun, a .410 shotgun . silencer, suppressor A device that muffles the sound of a firearm. They are colloquially known as silencers but are more accurately referred to as suppressors . The device reduces the sound a gun makes when it’s fired but does not eliminate the sound. They generally lower the sound level by 20 to 35 decibels, making most firearms still louder than the average ambulance siren. For clarity, describe the device as a firearm suppressor , and note that it is generally known in generic terms as a silencer . To legally purchase the device, it must be bought from a licensed dealer and the buyer must undergo an extensive background check. The background check, similar to what is required to purchase fully automatic weapons, is tightly regulated under the National Firearms Act of 1934. Each suppressor carries a serial number that can be tracked. Suppressors were invented in the early 1900s by MIT-educated Hiram Percy Maxim, who invented a muffler for gasoline engines. The devices were brought under National Firearms Act regulations after Depression-era game wardens were concerned hunters would use them to poach. submachine gun A lightweight fully automatic gun firing handgun ammunition."}

The study included males ages 10-21. She is the first female governor of North Carolina. Woman , women , man and men are usually reserved for use as a noun to describe adults, while girl , girls , boy and boys are typically used as a noun for people under age 18. Be aware of nuances and pitfalls in the use of female and woman/women . Since female primarily describes sex, not gender, some people object to its use as a descriptor for women because it can be seen as emphasizing biology and reproductive capacity over gender identity . It can also sometimes carry misogynistic tones that may vary in severity by race, class and other factors. For this reason, woman or women is increasingly common an adjective. But its use as such can often be awkward, especially if the words man or men would not be used adjectivally in a parallel sense. For instance: He is the only man construction worker on the otherwise all-woman crew is awkward, and He is the only male construction worker on the otherwise all-woman crew is not parallel. Options for being both sensitive and eloquent include He is the only man on the otherwise all-woman construction crew . Avoid using male and female as modifiers that could convey assumptions about gender roles, such as male nurse, male nanny, female bodybuilder , etc. In general, make a point of someone’s sex or gender only if clearly relevant.

To convert a temperature difference from Fahrenheit to Celsius, multiply by 5 and divide by 9. A difference of 18 degrees F is a 10-degree C difference. In cases that require mention of the scale, use these forms: 86 degrees Fahrenheit or 86 F (note the space and no period after the F ) if degrees and Fahrenheit are clear from the context.

Lowercase further condensations of the name: the department, the council , etc. For additional guidance see assembly ; city council ; committee ; Congress ; legislature ; House of Representatives ; Senate ; Supreme Court of the United States ; and supreme courts of the states . FLIP-FLOPPED NAMES: Retain capital names for the name of a governmental body if its formal name is flopped to delete the word of : the State Department, the Human Resources Department . GENERIC EQUIVALENTS: If a generic term has become the equivalent of a proper name in popular use, treat it as a proper name: Walpole State Prison , for example, even though the proper name is the Massachusetts Correctional Institute-Walpole . For additional examples, see legislature ; police department ; and prison, jail . PLURALS, NONSPECIFIC REFERENCES: All words that are capitalized when part of a proper name should be lowercased when they are used in the plural or do not refer to a specific, existing body. Some examples: All states except Nebraska have a state senate. The town does not have a fire department. The bill requires city councils to provide matching funds.

Then, more than 16 million Americans fought in World War II, and their pent-up desire to start families at war’s end unleashed the baby boom — more than 78 million births between the years 1946 and 1964, as defined by the U.S. Census Bureau. The baby boomers begat Generation X , which begat millennials , also known as Generation Y , which begat Generation Z ( Gen X, Gen Y and Gen Z are acceptable on second reference, and their members are called Gen Xers, Gen Yers and Gen Zers ). The next generation, the first born wholly in the 21st century, has been called Generation Alpha . The generations that preceded and followed the baby boom have no officially designated beginnings or endings. The Pew Research Center defines the Silent Generation as those born between 1928 and 1945, Generation X as 1965 to 1980, millennials as 1981 to 1996, and Generation Z as those born starting in 1997, with no specific end point. It also cautions that those eras are inexact. The time period should be specified when possible. While each of these generations shares common experiences — many baby boomers recall the day President John F. Kennedy was assassinated, and Sept. 11, 2001, is a millennial milestone — they are too often stereotyped as sharing common characteristics.

They also may be called Native Hawaiians, Indigenous people in Hawaii or Hawaii’s Indigenous people . When using the term Hawaiian , be sure context makes clear that the reference is to an Indigenous person or group. Hawaii is a creation of Hawaiians — the island chain was united by King Kamehameha and then was ruled by Hawaiians until the U.S.-backed overthrow of the monarchy in 1893. Many Hawaiians view Hawaii as a place that is rightfully theirs and a place to which they belong. Many Hawaiians believe the United States and the state of Hawaii are illegal occupiers of these lands and are fighting to return Hawaiian sovereignty to Hawaii. Someone can be Hawaiian even if they weren’t born in Hawaii or have never lived in Hawaii. To avoid confusion or misinterpretation, generally avoid the term Hawaii native for those born in Hawaii but not a member of the ethnic group. Instead, if relevant, say the person was born in Hawaii or similar language. Do not use the term Hawaiian for roads, statues or anything else unless it describes something that is culturally Hawaiian. For instance, a Hawaiian drum but a Hawaii vacation or a Hawaii road . The term Hawaiian Islands is correct and is the proper name. When in doubt, seek clarity that someone or something is actually Hawaiian . Avoid using the term if unclear. The state of Hawaii includes eight major islands. The largest island is Hawaii , commonly known as the Big Island or Hawaii Island .

Homeless is generally acceptable as an adjective to describe people without a fixed residence. Avoid dehumanizing collective nouns like the homeless , instead using constructions like homeless people, people without housing or people without homes . When possible, ask people how they wish to be identified and use their preference. Some advocates and others prefer the term unhoused in an effort to focus on a person’s lack of shelter. However, people without homes may have some sort of housing. So use unhoused only when quoting people, if an organization uses the term or if people use it for themselves. As with the homeless , avoid the term the unhoused . Do not stereotype homeless people as dirty, mentally ill, addicted to drugs or alcohol, reliant on charity, or criminals. Those conditions can often contribute to or be byproducts of homelessness , but many homeless people also hold jobs and are self-sufficient. Mention a person is homeless only when relevant. If a homeless person is accused of a crime, mention their city of residence, if available, the same way you would for anyone else: Roberts, of Los Angeles, was charged , not Roberts, who has no permanent address, was charged . And not: A homeless man was charged … Homeless shelter is an acceptable term for a building that provides free or very inexpensive but temporary indoor refuge for people without homes, generally run by a government or charity. Do not use flophouse . Government agencies do not always agree on what legally constitutes homelessness , but the term generally refers to people staying in shelters or on the street. Avoid disparaging terminology such as derelict, bum, beggar, tramp and hobo . Terms like couch surfing (staying temporarily in various households) or transient (someone who moves from city to city but is not necessarily homeless ) can be useful to describe specific situations. Avoid vagrant . A migrant is someone who moves from place to place for temporary work or economic advantage and is usually not considered homeless .

{"source_url": "https://www.apstylebook.com/ap_stylebook/headlines-3", "entry_header": "headlines", "text_content": "Headlines are key to any story. A vivid, accurate and fair headline can entice people to dig in for more. A bland, vague or otherwise faulty headline can push readers away. Often, a headline and photo are all that many readers see of a story. Their entire knowledge of the piece may be based on those elements. Headlines must stand on their own in conveying the story fairly, and they must include key context. They should tempt readers to want to read more, without misleading or overpromising. Other points: — Match the headline’s tone to the story’s: Most serious, hard news stories demand serious headlines; lighter stories call for clever, witty and creative approaches. Sometimes a lighter headline can work on serious stories, but use judgment. — Attribute carefully. Attribution is as important in headlines as in stories. — Think carefully about keywords, search engine optimization and social media optimization. What terms are readers likely to be searching for, or what will be easily recognizable and compelling in a print headline? Include keywords that are central to the story’s content, and consider what keywords relevant to the story are trending in search engines and social media. — Update headlines intended for online use as often as needed to reflect the latest news. — Capitalize only the first word and proper nouns in headlines that use AP style. Exception: The first word after a colon is always uppercase in headlines. — Always capitalize the first letter of a headline, even if it starts with a proper name such as iPhone or eBay , though recasting may be the better choice. — Avoid abbreviations and alphabet soup. Use only very universally recognized abbreviations. US, UK, UN and EU (no periods) are acceptable. Other acceptable shorthand includes FBI, CIA, IRS, SEC . — Avoid abbreviating state names when possible in headlines on AP stories. If the shorter version is essential for space reasons, do not use periods in those abbreviated with two capital letters: NY, NJ, NH, NM, NC, SC, ND, SD and RI . Also DC . Other state abbreviations retain periods: Ga., Ky., Mont., Conn. , etc. Do not use postal codes. — Use numerals; do not spell out numbers except in casual uses or formal names: hundreds instead of 100s ; Big Ten ; one of the first . Spell out ordinals under 10: first, ninth , etc. But: 10th, 23rd, 104th. — Use single quote marks, never double quote marks. — Label opinion or analysis pieces. AP headlines for news analyses must begin with Analysis: and reviews must begin with Review: — Make every word and every character count. AP headlines are limited to 100 characters; use those characters wisely. — For AP audiences, write headlines with a global online audience in mind. Locators are not needed for every headline. But use locators when the place name is likely to increase the chances of someone wanting to read the story, likely to be searched for by readers online, or when needed to understand the story (i.e, to differentiate between a federal Supreme Court vs. state Supreme Court decision). Other headline tips: — Co. Try not to use this or cos. to abbreviate for company or companies. — Federal Reserve. Fed is acceptable in headlines. — Government. Do not abbreviate. — Millions, billions. These figures can be abbreviated in headlines. For example, $45 million would be $45M , and $5 billion would be $5B . — Periods: Avoid using them when abbreviations are necessary: AP (a trademark), GI, ID, EU , etc. — Quarters. Use Q4 , not 4Q ."}

Use the term Hawaiian or Hawaiians only for members of the ethnic group indigenous to the Hawaiian Islands. They also may be called Native Hawaiians, Indigenous people in Hawaii or Hawaii’s Indigenous people . When using the term Hawaiian , be sure context makes clear that the reference is to an Indigenous person or group. Hawaii is a creation of Hawaiians — the island chain was united by King Kamehameha and then was ruled by Hawaiians until the U.S.-backed overthrow of the monarchy in 1893. Many Hawaiians view Hawaii as a place that is rightfully theirs and a place to which they belong. Many Hawaiians believe the United States and the state of Hawaii are illegal occupiers of these lands and are fighting to return Hawaiian sovereignty to Hawaii. Someone can be Hawaiian even if they weren’t born in Hawaii or have never lived in Hawaii. To avoid confusion or misinterpretation, generally avoid the term Hawaii native for those born in Hawaii but not a member of the ethnic group. Instead, if relevant, say the person was born in Hawaii or similar language. Do not use the term Hawaiian for roads, statues or anything else unless it describes something that is culturally Hawaiian. For instance, a Hawaiian drum but a Hawaii vacation or a Hawaii road . The term Hawaiian Islands is correct and is the proper name. When in doubt, seek clarity that someone or something is actually Hawaiian . Avoid using the term if unclear. The state of Hawaii includes eight major islands. The largest island is Hawaii , commonly known as the Big Island or Hawaii Island . The other main islands are Kahoolawe, Kauai, Lanai, Maui, Molokai, Oahu and Niihau . The archipelago also includes numerous smaller atolls. Collectively, the island chain is the Hawaiian Islands . Honolulu and Pearl Harbor are on Oahu, where more than two-thirds of the state’s residents live."}

Under the rules of war, foreign nationals were taken into custody, or interned, at facilities operated by the Justice Department. But acting under Executive Order 9066, issued by President Franklin D. Roosevelt, authorities also detained an estimated 120,000 Japanese Americans and Japanese nationals, most of them living on the West Coast. They were generally detained in camps operated by the War Relocation Authority. Though internment has been applied historically to all these detainments, the broad use of the term is inaccurate — about two-thirds of the 120,000 were U.S. citizens and thus could not be considered interns — and many Japanese Americans find it objectionable. It is better to say that they were incarcerated or detained , and to describe the larger event as the incarceration of Japanese Americans and nationals who had not been convicted of any crimes."}

It can include honest mistakes, exaggerations, and misunderstandings of facts, as well as disinformation , which refers to misinformation created and spread intentionally as a way to mislead or confuse. Misinformation can be transmitted in any medium, including social media, websites, printed materials and broadcast. It includes photography or video and audio recordings that have been created, manipulated or selectively edited. The term typically excludes opinions, as well as satire and parody. It does include hoaxes, propaganda and fabricated news stories. Avoid the term fake news other than when directly quoting someone using the term. Alternative wording includes false reports, erroneous reports, unverified reports, questionable reports, disputed reports or false reporting , depending on the context. If the term fake news is used in a direct quotation, push for specifics about what is meant. Fact-checking is essential in debunking fabricated stories or parts of stories, or other misinformation. This requires reporting or research to verify facts that affirm or disprove a statement, or that show a gray area. The goal of fact-checking is to push back on falsehoods, exaggeration and political spin, and to hold politicians and public figures accountable for their words. Basic fact-checking should always be part of the main story, including wording noting when an assertion differs with known facts. Often, however, additional reporting is required to explore disputed points or questions more fully.In those cases, separate stories may need to be done. Some points: Present the assertion that's being checked, and quickly state what's wrong with it or what is correct. Use the exact quote or quotes that are being examined. Follow with the facts, backed by appropriate citations and attribution. Stick to checking facts, rather than opinion. A person's personal tastes and preferences might lie outside the mainstream, but as opinions they are not a topic for a fact check. When fact-checking, stories need not show statements to be clearly correct or clearly incorrect. Words can be true, false, exaggerated, a stretch, a selective use of data, partly or mostly true, etc. Use the most apt description that's supported by what the facts show. If a statement can't be confirmed, or can't be immediately confirmed, say so. But describe the efforts made to confirm it. Usage notes: fact check and fact-checking (n.), to fact-check (v.)"}

The prefixes are: pico- (one-trillionth), nano- (one-billionth), micro- (one-millionth), milli- (one-thousandth), centi- (one-hundredth), deci- (one-tenth), deka- (10 units), hecto- (100 units), kilo- (1,000 units), mega- (1 million units), giga- (1 billion units), tera- (1 trillion units). Entries for each prefix show how to convert a unit preceded by the prefix to the basic unit. In addition, separate entries for gram , meter , liter , Celsius and other frequently used metric units define them and give examples of how to convert them to equivalents in the terminology that has been used in the United States. Similarly, entries for pound , inch , quart , Fahrenheit , etc., contain examples of how to convert these terms to metric forms. ABBREVIATIONS: The abbreviation mm for millimeter is acceptable in references to film widths ( 8 mm film ) and weapons ( a 105 mm cannon ). (Note space between numeral and abbreviation.) The principal abbreviations, for reference in the event they are used by a source, are: g (gram), kg (kilogram), t (metric ton), m (meter), cm (centimeter), km (kilometer), mm (millimeter), L (liter, capital L to avoid confusion with the figure 1) and mL (milliliter)."}

{"source_url": "https://www.apstylebook.com/ap_stylebook/merger-2", "entry_header": "merger", "text_content": "Few business combinations are truly a merger of equals, so be precise and sparing in the use of the word merger . It is not a synonym for acquisition or takeover, which should be the preferred descriptives in most stories. Use the following rules for deciding whether it's a merger or acquisition, and as a guide in concluding who is the acquirer and the company being taken over: –Is one of the companies' stock being used as the currency? If the answer is yes, that's usually a good sign that company is the acquirer and it is not a merger. –What is the message from the exchange ratio in stock transactions? Typically when shareholders of Company A are offered new shares in a combined company at a 1-for-1 ratio, and Company B shares are exchanged at something less or more (i.e., each Company B will be exchanged for 0.47% of a share of the new company), it's an indication that Company A's stock is being used as the basis for the transaction. But it also could be a sign that the companies' boards have agreed to a merger that uses a formula to compensate for the differing market value (total number of shares multiplied by the closing stock price the day before the announcement) of the two companies to come up with an exchange ratio for stock in the new company. –What is the message from the stock movements after the announcement? Shares of companies being acquired typically rise and shares of the acquirer often fall after the announcement. Not always, of course, but that's usually the case because most bidders pay a premium, or an above-market price, for the shares of the company being acquired, and investors often are worried about the amount of debt the acquirer is taking on to complete the transaction. –Whose cash is being used to fund the cash portion of a transaction? If the announcement says Company A's cash will be used or that its existing lines of credit will be tapped to pay for Company B's shares, that's a strong indication that Company A is the acquirer. –Which company's executives are filling most of the top management roles? The key distinction usually is who gets the CEO slot. But if one of the two CEOs is named to head the company for a limited period (say two years or less) before his fellow CEO takes over, that's a good sign of a political compromise to paper over the fact that the second CEO's company is going to be in charge long term. –Which company will end up with the majority of the seats on the new board of directors? This is often a key tie breaker. When Company A and Company B insist it's a merger of equals and other checklist items are inconclusive, if one ends up with 60% of the board seats and the other gets 40%, that's a good indication of which is going to be in charge. Also, make sure you get not only the short-term makeup of the board of the combined company, but also whether there were any deals cut for some members to retire in short order. –Where will the company be headquartered? Since CEOs typically do the negotiating and they typically aren't anxious to move, this can be an informative tell."}

{"source_url": "https://www.apstylebook.com/ap_stylebook/mental-illness", "entry_header": "mental illness", "text_content": "The terms mental illness and mentally ill include a broad range of conditions. For guidance on specific conditions, see individual entries throughout the Stylebook. Do not describe an individual as having a mental illness unless it is clearly pertinent to a story and the diagnosis is properly sourced. When used, identify the source for the diagnosis. Seek firsthand knowledge derived from a medical examination; ask how the source knows. Don't rely on hearsay or speculate on a diagnosis. Avoid anonymous sources. On-the-record sources may be family members, mental health professionals, medical authorities, law enforcement officials or court records. If someone says a person has a history of mental illness , seek details. If those details aren't immediately available, say so in the story and do additional reporting to follow up. Include those details in later stories. Specify the time frame for the diagnosis and ask about treatment. A person's condition can change over time, so a diagnosis of mental illness might not currently apply. If used, comments about a history of mental illness must be attributed to law enforcement authorities, medical professionals, family members or others who have knowledge of the history and can authoritatively speak to its relevance. In the absence of definitive information, there should be a disclaimer that a link to a crime or other event had yet to be established. Do not assume that mental illness is a factor in a violent crime, and avoid unsubstantiated statements by witnesses or first responders attributing violence to mental illness. Studies have shown that the vast majority of people with mental illnesses are not violent, and experts say most people who are violent do not have mental illnesses. Avoid interpreting behavior common to many people as symptoms of mental illness. Sadness, anger, exuberance and the occasional desire to be alone are normal emotions experienced by people who have mental illness as well as those who don't. When practical, let people with mental illness talk about their own diagnoses. Other points: Be specific about the condition whenever possible and include sourcing: The man accused in the killing was diagnosed with schizophrenia, according to court documents. She was diagnosed with anorexia, according to her parents. He said he was treated for depression. Avoid wording such as he is a schizophrenic or he is mentally ill unless a person describes themself that way. Avoid descriptions that connote pity, such as afflicted with, suffers from, victim of, battling and demons . Rather, he has obsessive-compulsive disorder . Avoid dehumanizing \"the\" terms such as the mentally ill . Instead: people with mental illnesses . Do not use derogatory terms, such as insane, crazy/crazed, nuts or deranged , unless they are part of a quotation that is essential to the story. Avoid using mental illness-related words lightly or in unrelated situations. Some examples: calling a person or an idea demented, psychotic, catatonic , etc.; or saying an awards show was schizophrenic . Alternatives include: The idea is deeply flawed or misguided ; the pressure is intense ; the schedule is demanding ; the strategy is ineffective . See disabilities ; addiction ; bipolar disorder ; depression ; diseases ; obsessive-compulsive disorder ; phobia ; postpartum depression ; post-traumatic stress disorder ; seasonal affective disorder . See the Health and Science chapter."}

COMPUTING PLURALITY: To describe how large a plurality is, take the highest number and subtract from it the next highest number: If, in the election example above, the second-place finisher had 25,000 votes, the winner's plurality would be 35,000 votes. Suppose, however, that no candidate in this example had a majority.

In a reactor core, atoms of fuel, such as uranium, are split. This releases energy in the form of heat which, in turn, is used to boil water for steam. The steam powers a turbine, and the turbine drives a generator to produce electricity. fission The splitting of the nucleus of an atom, releasing energy. gray (Gy) The standard measure of radiation a material has absorbed. It has largely replaced the rad . One gray equals 100 rads. This measure does not consider biological effect of the radiation. meltdown The worst possible nuclear accident in which the reactor core overheats to such a degree that the fuel melts. If the fuel penetrates its protective housing, radioactive materials will be released into the environment. rad See gray . radiation Invisible particles or waves given off by radioactive material, such as uranium. Radiation can damage or kill body cells, resulting in latent cancers, genetic damage or death. rem See sievert . roentgen The standard measure of X-ray exposure. sievert (Sv) The standard measure of radiation absorbed in living tissue, adjusted for different kinds of radiation so that a single sievert of any kind of radiation produces the same biological effect. The sievert has largely replaced the rem . One Sv equals 100 rem. A millisievert (mSv) is a thousandth of a sievert; a millirem is a thousandth of a rem.

It is backed only by the corporation's reputation and promise to pay. default A person, corporation or government is in default if it fails to meet the terms for repayment. full faith and credit bond An alternate term for general obligation bond, often used to contrast such a bond with a moral obligation bond. general obligation bond A bond that has had the formal approval of either the voters or their legislature. The government's promise to repay the principal and pay the interest is constitutionally guaranteed on the strength of its ability to tax the population. maturity The date on which a bond, debenture or note must be repaid. moral obligation bond A government bond that has not had the formal approval of either the voters or their legislature. It is backed only by the government's \"moral obligation\" to repay the principal and interest on time. municipal bond A general obligation bond issued by a state, county, city, town, village, possession or territory, or a bond issued by an agency or authority set up by one of these governmental units. In general, interest paid on municipal bonds is exempt from federal income taxes. It also usually is exempt from state and local taxes if held by someone living within the state of issue. note A certificate issued by a corporation or government stating the amount of a loan, the interest to be paid and the collateral pledged in the event payment cannot be made. The date for repayment is generally more than a year after issue but not more than seven or eight years later. The shorter interval for repayment is the principal difference between a note and a bond. revenue bond A bond backed only by the revenue of the airport, turnpike or other facility that was built with the money it raised. Treasury borrowing A Treasury bill is a certificate representing a loan to the federal government that matures in three, six or 12 months. A Treasury note may mature in one to 10 years or more. A Treasury bond matures in more than 10 years. Because Treasurys carry the full backing of the government, they are viewed as the safest investment."}

The result is the number of barrels in the shipment. — Multiply the number of barrels by 42. The result is the number of gallons. EXAMPLE: A tanker spills 20,000 metric tons of foreign crude petroleum. The table shows 6.998 barrels of foreign crude petroleum per metric ton. Multiply 6.998 x 20,000 equals 139,960 barrels.

Payments generally are made in quarterly installments. If a company shows no profit during a given period, it may be able to use earnings retained from profitable periods to pay its dividend on schedule. earnings per share (or loss per share , for companies posting a net loss) The figure obtained by dividing the number of outstanding shares of common stock into the amount left after dividends have been paid on any preferred stock. extraordinary loss, extraordinary income An expense or source of income that does not occur on a regular basis, such as a loss due to a major fire or the revenue from the sale of a subsidiary. Extraordinary items should be identified in any report on the company's financial status to avoid creating the false impression that its overall profit trend has suddenly plunged or soared. gross profit The difference between the sales price of an item or service and the expenses directly attributed to it, such as the cost of raw materials, labor and overhead linked to the production effort. income before taxes Gross profits minus companywide expenses not directly attributed to specific products or services. These expenses typically include interest costs, advertising and sales costs, and general administrative overhead. net income, profit, earnings The amount left after taxes and preferred dividends have been paid. Some of what remains may be paid in dividends to holders of common stock. The rest may be invested to obtain interest revenue or spent to acquire new buildings or equipment to increase the company's ability to make further profits. To avoid confusion, do not use the word income alone – always specify whether the figure is income before taxes or net income . The terms profit and earnings commonly are interpreted as meaning the amount left after taxes. The terms net profit and net earnings are acceptable synonyms. return on investment A percentage figure obtained by dividing the company's assets into its net income. revenue The amount of money a company took in, including interest earned and receipts from sales, services provided, rents and royalties. The figure also may include excise taxes and sales taxes collected for the government. If it does, the fact should be noted in any report on revenue. The singular form is preferable in most uses. sales The money a company received for the goods and services it sold. In some cases the figure includes receipts from rents and royalties.

Some traditionalists left the U.S. denomination to form the Anglican Church in North America. The Episcopal Church is governed nationally by two bodies — the permanent Executive Council and the General Convention, which meets every three years. After the council, the principal organizational units are, in descending order of size: provinces, dioceses or missionary districts, local parishes and local missions. The Executive Council is composed of bishops, priests, laypeople. One bishop is designated leader of the church and holds the formal title of presiding bishop. The General Convention has final authority in matters of policy and doctrine. All acts must pass both of its houses — the House of Bishops and the House of Deputies. The latter is composed of an equal number of clergy and lay delegates from each diocese. A province is composed of several dioceses. Each has a provincial synod made up of a house of bishops and a house of deputies. The synod’s primary duty is to coordinate the work of the church in its area. Within a diocese, a bishop is the principal official. The bishop is helped by the Diocesan Convention, which consists of all the clergy in the diocese and lay representatives from each parish. The parish or local church is governed by a vestry, composed of the pastor and lay members elected by the congregation. The clergy consists of bishops, priests and deacons. A priest who heads a parish is described as a rector rather than a pastor. For first reference to bishops, use Bishop before the individual’s name: Bishop Rob Wright . An acceptable alternative in referring to U.S. bishops is the Rt. Rev. The designation the Most Rev. is used before the names of the archbishops of Canterbury and York. For first references, use the Rev. before the name of a priest, Deacon before the name of a deacon. See Anglican Communion and religious titles ."}
{"source_url": "https://www.apstylebook.com/ap_stylebook/catholic-church", "entry_header": "Catholic Church", "text_content": "The church teaches that its bishops have been established as the successors of the apostles through generations of ceremonies in which authority was passed down by a laying-on of hands. Responsibility for teaching the faithful and administering the church rests with the bishops. However, the church holds that the pope has final authority over their actions because he is the bishop of Rome, the office it teaches was held by the Apostle Peter at his death. The Curia serves as a form of governmental cabinet. Its members, appointed by the pope, handle both administrative and judicial functions. The pope also chooses members of the College of Cardinals, who serve as his principal counselors. When a new pope must be chosen, they meet in a conclave to select a new pope by a two-thirds majority vote. In practice, cardinals are mostly bishops, but there is no requirement that a cardinal be a bishop. In the United States, the church’s principal organizational units are archdioceses and dioceses. They are headed, respectively, by archbishops and bishops, who have final responsibility for many activities within their jurisdictions and report directly to Rome. A caution: Roman Catholic , which refers to the Latin branch of Catholicism, is not the appropriate first reference when referring to the pope, the Vatican or the universal church. Catholic Church should be used instead, since it encompasses believers belonging to the Latin (Roman) and Eastern churches. Similarly, the U.S. Conference of Catholic Bishops includes bishops from Eastern churches as well as Roman Catholic bishops. See Catholic, Catholicism . The church counts more than 1 billion members worldwide. In the United States estimates vary, but it is the largest single body of Christians in the nation. Roman Catholics believe in the Trinity — that there is one God who exists as three divine persons — the Father, the Son and the Holy Spirit. They believe that the Son became man as Jesus Christ. In addition to the Holy Eucharist, there are six other sacraments — baptism, confirmation, penance (often called the sacrament of reconciliation), matrimony, holy orders, and the sacrament of the sick (formerly extreme unction). The clergy below pope are, in descending order of prominence, cardinal, archbishop, bishop, monsignor, priest and deacon. In religious orders, some men who are not priests have the title brother . Capitalize pope when used as a title before a name: Pope John XXIII, Pope Francis . Lowercase in all other uses. See religious titles . The first-reference forms for other titles follow. Use only last names on second reference. Cardinals: Cardinal Daniel DiNardo . The usage Daniel Cardinal DiNardo , a practice traceable to the nobility’s custom of identifications such as William, Duke of Norfolk , is still used in formal documents but otherwise is considered archaic. Archbishops: Archbishop Gregory Aymond , or the Most Rev. Gregory Aymond, archbishop of New Orleans . Bishops: Bishop Thomas Paprocki , or the Most Rev.

Instead, seek specific and detailed information from authorities, such as a gun’s make, model, caliber and magazine capacity. For example, Authorities said the shooter used a Smith & Wesson M&P15 rifle or Authorities said the man used an AR-style semiautomatic rifle with a 30-round magazine . Use more generalized descriptions, such as rifle or handgun , until such details become available. Under federal law, automatic rifles are restricted in the United States to their manufacturers; licensed dealers; the military; law enforcement; and civilians who have special permission to own such weapons, provided that the weapons were imported or domestically manufactured before May 19, 1986. Other terms: anti-aircraft A cannon or other weapon designed for defense against air attack. The form: a 105 mm anti-aircraft gun . artillery A carriage-mounted cannon. automatic A firearm that reloads automatically after each shot. The term should not be used to describe the rate of fire. To avoid confusion, specify fully automatic or semiautomatic rather than simply automatic. Give the type of weapon or model for clarity. bolt-action rifle A manually operated handle on the barrel opens and closes the breech, ejecting a spent round, loading another and cocking the weapon for triggering. Popular for hunting and target-shooting. Example: Remington 700 . Some shotguns are bolt-action. buckshot See shot . bullet The projectile fired by a rifle, pistol or machine gun. Together with metal casing, primer and propellant, it forms a cartridge . caliber A measurement of the diameter of the inside of a gun barrel except for most shotguns. Measurement is in either millimeters or decimal fractions of an inch. The word caliber is not used when giving the metric measurement. The forms: a 9 mm pistol, a .22-caliber rifle . cannon A weapon, usually supported on some type of carriage, that fires explosive projectiles. The form: a 105 mm cannon . Plural is cannons . carbine A short, lightweight rifle, usually having a barrel length of less than 20 inches. The form: an M3 carbine . cartridge See bullet . clip Do not use this term unless in a quote. The correct term is magazine to describe the device used to store multiple rounds of ammunition together as a unit, ready for insertion into a firearm. A clip is a device that stores rounds together that can then be used to load bullets into a magazine . See magazine for a fuller description. Colt Named for Samuel Colt, it designates a make of weapon or ammunition developed for Colt handguns. The forms: a Colt .45-caliber revolver, .45 Colt ammunition . fully automatic A firearm that fires continuously as long as the trigger is depressed. Examples include machine guns and submachine guns . gauge The measure of the size of a shotgun. Gauge is expressed in terms of the number per pound of round lead balls with a diameter equal to the size of the barrel. The bigger the number, the smaller the shotgun. The forms: a 12-gauge shotgun, a .410 shotgun . The .410 actually is a caliber, but commonly is called a gauge. The ball leaving the barrel is 0.41” in diameter. ghost guns Privately made firearms that lack serial numbers used to trace them and are often purchased without a background check. Law enforcement officials have reported ghost guns have increasingly been used in violent crimes across the U.S. Avoid describing them as untraceable guns and instead say they are harder for law enforcement to trace. handgun A pistol or a revolver . howitzer A cannon shorter than a gun of the same caliber employed to fire projectiles at relatively high angles at a target, such as opposing forces behind a ridge. The form: a 105 mm howitzer . lever-action rifle A handle on the stock ejects and loads cartridges and cocks the rifle for triggering. A firearm often associated with the Old West. Example: Winchester 94 . M1, M16 These and similar combinations of a letter and figure(s) designate rifles used by the military. The forms: an M1 rifle, an M16 rifle . machine gun A fully automatic gun that fires as long as the trigger is depressed and bullets are chambered. Such a weapon is generally so large and heavy that it rests on the ground or a mount. A submachine gun is hand-held. The form: a .50-caliber Browning machine gun . magazine The ammunition storage and feeding device within or attached to a firearm. It may be fixed to the firearm or detachable. It is not a clip . Magnum A trademark for a type of high-powered cartridge with a larger case and a larger powder charge than other cartridges of approximately the same caliber. The form: a .357 Magnum, a .44 Magnum . mortar Device used to launch a mortar shell; it is the shell, not the mortar, that is fired. musket A heavy, large-caliber shoulder firearm fired by means of a matchlock, a wheel lock, a flintlock or a percussion lock. Its ammunition is a musket ball. pistol A handgun that can be a single-shot or a semiautomatic. Differs from a revolver in that the chamber and barrel are one integral part. Its size is measured in calibers. The form: a .45-caliber pistol . revolver A handgun. Differs from a pistol in that cartridges are held in chambers in a cylinder that revolves through the barrel. The form: a .45-caliber revolver . rifle A firearm designed or made to be fired from the shoulder and having a rifled bore. It uses bullets or cartridges for ammunition. Its size is measured in calibers. The form: a .22-caliber rifle . Saturday night special A compact, relatively inexpensive handgun. semiautomatic A firearm that fires only once for each pull of the trigger. It reloads after each shot. The form: a semiautomatic rifle, a semiautomatic weapon, a semiautomatic pistol . shell The word applies to military or naval ammunition and to shotgun ammunition. For small arms, bullet or round is the common term for ammunition. shot Small lead or steel pellets fired by shotguns. A shotgun shell usually contains 1 to 2 ounces of shot. Do not use shot interchangeably with buckshot , which refers only to the largest shot sizes. shotgun A firearm typically used to fire small spherical pellets called shot. Shotguns usually have a smooth bore barrel, but some contain a rifled barrel, which is used to fire a single projectile. Size is measured according to gauge, except for the .410, which is measured according to caliber, meaning the ball leaving the barrel is 0.41” in diameter. The form: a 12-gauge shotgun, a .410 shotgun . silencer, suppressor A device that muffles the sound of a firearm. They are colloquially known as silencers but are more accurately referred to as suppressors . The device reduces the sound a gun makes when it’s fired but does not eliminate the sound. They generally lower the sound level by 20 to 35 decibels, making most firearms still louder than the average ambulance siren. For clarity, describe the device as a firearm suppressor , and note that it is generally known in generic terms as a silencer . To legally purchase the device, it must be bought from a licensed dealer and the buyer must undergo an extensive background check. The background check, similar to what is required to purchase fully automatic weapons, is tightly regulated under the National Firearms Act of 1934. Each suppressor carries a serial number that can be tracked. Suppressors were invented in the early 1900s by MIT-educated Hiram Percy Maxim, who invented a muffler for gasoline engines. The devices were brought under National Firearms Act regulations after Depression-era game wardens were concerned hunters would use them to poach. submachine gun A lightweight fully automatic gun firing handgun ammunition."}

{"source_url": "https://www.apstylebook.com/ap_stylebook/philanthropy", "entry_header": "philanthropy", "text_content": "Philanthropy coverage focuses on charitable acts or gifts that help others or society as a whole. While that applies to donations made anywhere in the world, in the United States philanthropic organizations are generally defined by their tax status. Some terms: nonprofit vs. not-for-profit In the U.S., a nonprofit organization is one that has tax-exempt status from the IRS and has a stated mission to provide a public benefit and often can receive a tax-deductible donation. Examples include a charity, church or other social welfare group. That's in contrast to a for-profit organization, which operates in order to generate revenue for its owners, like most businesses. A not-for-profit organization is not required to operate for the public good and donations to the organization are not tax-deductible, even if it has IRS tax-exempt status. Nonprofits are categorized based on what section of the Internal Revenue Code governs their type of organization. There are 29 types, but the most common are: 501(c)(3) : Organizations created for what the U.S. tax code defines as \"social welfare,\" they are generally seen as charitable, educational or religious groups. They have tax-exempt status and donations to them are tax-deductible. To maintain that status, their work cannot primarily focus on lobbying for a single political candidate or party. 501(c)(4) : Also created for \"social welfare,\" but these organizations are allowed to donate to specific political candidates or parties and lobby for them. Donations to these groups are not tax-deductible. Generally, refer to the nonprofits based on their stated missions: The charity is dedicated to supporting earthquake victims or The homeless shelter has seen an increased demand for its services . Use the tax code designation in stories questioning whether the group is using its funding properly or to differentiate nonprofits working in the same sector. crowdfunding Fundraising for individuals and organizations done generally by raising small amounts of money from large numbers of people through online platforms, including GoFundMe, Kickstarter and Indiegogo. Whether it is considered philanthropy depends on what organization gets the money and how the organization plans to use it. donor-advised fund Special charitable investment account where people immediately receive tax breaks for what they contribute, even if it takes years for those contributions to be donated to an actual nonprofit. Do not use the abbreviation DAF unless in a direct quotation; explain the meaning if used. endowment A fund used by nonprofits to generate ongoing revenue. Generally, it refers to a base of assets that are invested so that the proceeds can be spent by the nonprofit on expenses. Nonprofits can have multiple revenue streams aside from endowments. Nonprofit public universities, for example, can receive funding from the government, as well as from an endowment. foundation A nonprofit organization that makes grants to other nonprofits with charitable purposes. (Generally, a private foundation's money comes from a single person, family, or corporation. Money from a public foundation, or community foundation, comes from multiple sources.) fundraise, fundraiser, fundraising An event or campaign designed to generate money for a nonprofit or cause. No hyphen, no space. giving circle A group of people (not organizations) who pool their funds and collectively decide where to donate them. No hyphen. Define on first reference. GivingTuesday The first Tuesday after Thanksgiving is known as GivingTuesday, when individuals are encouraged to make donations to nonprofits. No space between the two words. The group that handles the administration of the day is also known as GivingTuesday, born from a social media campaign known as #GivingTuesday in 2012. grantmaker Organization that makes donations to nonprofits. (No space between the two words. Same with grantmaking.) An exception to the -maker entry. LYBUNT Avoid this shorthand used by some to describe donors who gave \"last year but unfortunately not this.\" Also avoid SYBUNT for donors who will give \"some year but unfortunately not this.\" If a source uses the terms to discuss donations, generally avoid a direct quotation and paraphrase instead. If the direct quotation is essential, explain the term or terms. nongovernmental organization, NGO Generally spell out on first reference this term, which refers to any organization outside the United States that is not part of a government. NGO is acceptable on second reference and in headlines. Generally, NGOs address social or public welfare needs. Though they are usually nonprofits, some receive funding from governments. The term NGO typically does not refer to nonprofits based or operating in the U.S., only to those outside the country. payout requirement The obligation of private  foundations in the United States to use 5% of their net investment assets each year for the public good in return for receiving tax-exempt status from the government. restricted funds Donations that a recipient can apply only to a certain program or usage. Unrestricted funds are available for any use by the recipient."}

PFAS is acceptable on first reference as part of a phrase: a group of chemicals known as PFAS . Use the unabbreviated name on second reference or elsewhere in the story: PFAS is an abbreviation for perfluoroalkyl and polyfluoroalkyl substances . The shorthand per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances is acceptable but not preferred. PFAS were developed as coatings to protect consumer goods from stains, water and corrosion. Nonstick cookware, carpets, outdoor gear and food packaging are among items that contain the chemicals. They also are an ingredient in firefighting foams. PFAS are often described as forever chemicals because some don't degrade naturally and are believed capable of lingering indefinitely in the environment. According to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, human health effects from exposure to low environmental levels of PFAS are uncertain. Studies of laboratory animals given large amounts of PFAS have found that some PFAS may affect growth and development, reproduction, thyroid function, the immune system, and the liver. PFAS have been found increasingly in ground and surface waters. The federal government does not regulate PFAS in drinking water, although some states are developing limits. They have been found in a variety of wildlife species, including fish, bald eagles and mink. About 5,000 variations have been produced. The most common are known as PFOA (perfluorooctanoic acid) and PFOS (perfluorooctanesulfonic acid), which no longer are manufactured in the U.S. but remain widespread in soil and water. If needed to refer to them specifically, PFOA and PFOS are acceptable on all references in a story about PFAS."}

{"source_url": "https://www.apstylebook.com/ap_stylebook/nobility", "entry_header": "nobility", "text_content": "References to members of the nobility in nations that have a system of rank present special problems because nobles frequently are known by their titles rather than their given or family names. Their titles, in effect, become their names. Generally follow a person's preference, unless the person is widely known in another way. The guidelines below relate to Britain's nobility. Adapt them as appropriate to members of nobility in other nations. Orders of rank among British nobility begin with the royal family. The term royalty is reserved for the families of living and deceased sovereigns. Next, in descending order, are dukes, marquesses or marquises, earls, viscounts and barons. There are also life peers who are appointed to the House of Lords and hold their titles only for their lifetimes. On first reference to a life peer, use the person's ordinary name, e.g., Andrew Lloyd Webber or Jeffrey Archer . Elsewhere, if relevant, explain that the person has been appointed to the House of Lords. Occasionally the sovereign raises an individual to the nobility and makes the title inheritable by the person's heirs, but the practice is rare. Sovereigns also confer honorary titles, which do not make an individual a member of the nobility. The principal designations are baronet and knight . In general, the guidelines in titles apply. However, honorary titles and titles of nobility are capitalized when they serve as an alternate name. Some guidelines and examples: ROYALTY: Capitalize king, queen, prince and princess when they are used directly before one or more names; lowercase when they stand alone: King Charles III. The king or Charles on second reference. Capitalize a longer form of the sovereign's title when its use is in a direct quotation: His Majesty King Charles III. Use Prince or Princess before the names of a sovereign's children: Prince William, Prince Harry . The king’s wife is Queen Camilla . On second reference: Camilla . The male heir to the throne normally is designated Prince of Wales , and the title becomes an alternate name. Capitalize when used: The king invested his eldest son as Prince of Wales. Prince William is now the Prince of Wales. His wife , the former Kate Middleton, is Princess of Wales . Their children are Prince George, Princess Charlotte and Prince Louis . A prince or princess is just William, George or Harry on second reference, as is a princess, whether she is Charlotte, Beatrice or Eugenie . Charles' younger son is called Prince Harry on first reference, and then simply Harry . He is also the Duke of Sussex . His wife is the Duchess of Sussex . She may be called Meghan on first reference. She is not called Meghan Markle , though she can be referred to as the former Meghan Markle , and she is not Princess Meghan or Duchess Meghan . After leaving full-time royal duties in 2020, the couple do not use the titles His Royal Highness and Her Royal Highness . The children of Harry and Meghan are Prince Archie and Princess Lilibet . DUKE: The full title – Duke of York , for example – is an alternate name, capitalized in all uses. Lowercase duke when it stands alone. The wife of a duke is a duchess : the Duchess of Kent, the duchess , but never Duchess Katharine or Lady Katharine . Use the courtesy titles Lord or Lady before the first names of a duke or earl's children. On second reference, the children's given name would be used alone. MARQUESS, MARQUIS, EARL, VISCOUNT, BARON: The full titles serve as alternate names and should be capitalized. In general, use the name the person goes by. Use Lady before the name of a woman married to a man who holds one of these titles, and use Lady before the first name of an earl's daughter – Lady Diana Spencer , for example. On second reference, Lady Diana or Diana . BARONET, KNIGHT: Sir John Smith on first reference and Smith on second. These are very common titles, and rarely are used in news copy. Do not use both an honorary title and a title of military rank or authority, such as prime minister, before a name. Honorary titles for celebrities are rarely used. Dame Maggie Smith is correct, but Maggie Smith is preferred when writing about the actress. Sir Paul McCartney is correct, but Paul McCartney is preferred when writing about the former Beatle."}

If an individual has a preference for an English spelling that is different from the one that would result by applying these guidelines, follow the individual's preference. Example: Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov . For last names, use the English spelling that most closely approximates the pronunciation in Russian. Exception: the \"ev\" ending of names like Gorbachev may be pronounced \"yov.\" If an individual has a preference for an English spelling that is different from the one that would result by applying these guidelines, follow the individual's preference. Russian names never end in off , except for common mistransliterations such as Rachmaninoff . Instead, the transliterations should end in ov : Romanov .

The term riot suggests uncontrolled chaos and pandemonium. Focusing on rioting and property destruction rather than underlying grievance has been used in the past to stigmatize broad swaths of people protesting against lynching or police brutality or for racial justice, going back at least to the urban uprisings of the 1960s in the U.S. Inciting to riot is a longstanding criminal offense involving two or more people. In the United States, a federal criminal anti-riot act was enacted in 1968 in response to violent civil disturbances and protests of that era. Unrest is a vaguer, milder and less emotional term for a condition of angry discontent and protest verging on revolt. Protest and demonstration refer to specific actions such as marches, sit-ins, rallies or other actions meant to register dissent. They can be legal or illegal, organized or spontaneous, peaceful or violent, and involve any number of people. Revolt and uprising both suggest a broader political dimension or civil upheavals, a sustained period of protests, or unrest against powerful groups or governing systems."}

(When market forces, not the government, push a currency up, it is known as appreciation.) Suppose China revalues its currency, the yuan, against the U.S. dollar. To calculate the revaluation, you'd look at the value of 1 yuan to the U.S. dollar before the revaluation and the value afterward and calculate the percentage difference. Example: On Monday, 1 yuan is worth 15.8 cents (or $0.158). On Tuesday, the Chinese government revalues the currency and 1 yuan is equal to 16.1 cents ($0.161). That is a 1.9% revaluation – the yuan has risen 1.9% against the U.S. dollar. Currencies are often reported the other way, showing how much $1 is worth in another currency. In the example above, $1 went from being worth 6.32 yuan to being worth only 6.21 yuan. To find out what 1 yuan is worth – so you can show the yuan rising, not the dollar falling – divide 1 by 6.32 and 6.21 respectively."}

In many cases, the Rev. is the designation that applies before a name on first reference. Use the Rev. Dr. only if the individual has an earned doctoral degree (doctor of divinity degrees frequently are honorary) and reference to the degree is relevant. On second reference to members of the clergy, use only a last name: the Rev. Billy Graham on first reference, Graham on second. If known only by a religious name, repeat the title: Pope John XXIII on first reference, John , the pope or the pontiff on second; Pope Emeritus Benedict XVI or Benedict XVI, the pope emeritus . Benedict alone on second reference. Metropolitan Herman on first reference, Metropolitan Herman or the metropolitan on second. Detailed guidance on specific titles and descriptive words such as priest and minister is provided in the entries for major denominations. In general, however: CARDINALS, ARCHBISHOPS, BISHOPS: The preferred form for first reference is to use Cardinal , Archbishop or Bishop before the individual's name: Cardinal Daniel DiNardo , archbishop of Galveston-Houston . On second reference: DiNardo or the cardinal . Substitute the Most Rev. if applicable and appropriate in the context: He spoke to the Most Rev. Jose Gomez, archbishop of Los Angeles. On second reference: Gomez or the archbishop . Entries for individual denominations tell when the Most Rev. , the Very Rev. , etc., are applicable. MINISTERS AND PRIESTS: Use the Rev. before a name on first reference. Substitute Monsignor before the name of a Roman Catholic priest who has received this honor. Do not routinely use curate , father , pastor and similar words before an individual's name. If they appear before a name in a quotation, capitalize them. RABBIS: Use Rabbi before a name on first reference. On second reference, use only the last name. NUNS: Always use Sister , or Mother if applicable, before a name: Sister Agnes Rita in all references if the nun uses only a religious name; Sister Mary Ann Walsh on first reference if she uses a surname. Walsh on subsequent references. OFFICEHOLDERS: The preferred first-reference form for those who hold church office but are not ordained clergy in the usual sense is to use a construction that sets the title apart from the name by commas. Capitalize the formal title of an office, however, if it is used directly before an individual's name."}

Include party affiliation if a politician's actions could reasonably be seen as having an effect on policy or debate, or if readers need it for understanding. But reference to party affiliation is not necessary when a story has no link to politics. If in doubt, err on the side of including party affiliation. – Party affiliation can be used on first reference when it is the most important element to connect with the subject: Republican Sen. Tim Scott of South Carolina said ... – On second reference to add context between the party affiliation and the rest of the story: Rep. Frank Lucas of Oklahoma, the senior Republican on the House Agriculture Committee, said he supports the amendment. – Leave out when the story is clearly not political: The governor attended the NCAA Tournament basketball game, having graduated from Villanova in 1995. The senator attended her daughter's high school graduation. – But use when a political connection exists: The Democratic governor sat courtside next to the top donor to his campaign. The Republican senator spoke at her daughter's graduation two weeks after voting on the education bill. In stories about party meetings, such as a report on the Republican National Convention, no specific reference to party affiliation is necessary unless an individual is not a member of the party in question. SHORT-FORM PUNCTUATION: Set short forms such as R-S.C. off from a name by commas: Sen. Tim Scott, R-S.C., said … Use the abbreviations listed in the entries for each state. (No abbreviations for Alaska , Hawaii , Idaho , Iowa , Maine , Ohio , Texas and Utah .) FORM FOR U.S. HOUSE MEMBERS: The normal practice for U.S. House members is to identify them by party and state. In contexts where state affiliation is clear and home city is relevant, such as a state election roundup, identify representatives by party and city: U.S. Reps. Ander Crenshaw, R-Jacksonville, and Frederica Wilson, D-Miami . If this option is used, be consistent throughout the story. FORM FOR STATE LEGISLATORS: Short-form listings showing party and home city are appropriate in state stories. For national stories, the normal practice is to say that the individual is a Republican or Democrat . Use a short-form listing only if the legislator's home city is relevant.

Advocates praise it as a way to save children from those public schools that are struggling and, increasingly, to put children in schools that prioritize a certain political ideology. Opponents note that it diverts money from public schools. Avoid using the general term when possible; specifics are better: The teachers union objects to the charter school bill; a proposed school voucher bill will be debated next week. School choice options include: charter schools: Publicly funded, privately run, tuition-free public schools that operate independently of the local school district and with some autonomy over scheduling and curricula. Most charter schools are operated by nonprofit organizations but some states allow for-profit organizations to manage them. A handful of states lack charter school laws and do not allow them. Like traditional public schools, charter schools receive public money based on the number of students they enroll. They operate under a charter or performance contract authorized, depending on state law, by local school districts, the state, a higher education institution or nonprofit organization. magnet schools: Public schools outside of the neighborhood public school that offer specialized curricula and to which students must apply. vouchers: Allocations of per-child public funding that can be used toward private-school tuition. Education Savings Accounts: Government-authorized accounts into which public funds are deposited for families who withdraw their children from public school. They can be used for private-school tuition, online learning tutoring or approved higher education expenses. Explain the term on first use. homeschooling (n.) homeschooler (n.) homeschool (v.) homeschooled (adj.): An alternative to public or private school, typically conducted at home by a parent. Oversight of student evaluations, curricula and parental qualifications varies by state. private schools: Operate independently of local, state or federal governments and without public money. Funding comes from student tuition, endowments, donations and grants from religious or other organizations. Some schools are using alternatives to the traditional classroom model in their instruction. Among them: distance learning: An alternative to in-person classroom education. Student and instructor are physically separated and students complete much of the coursework online. Popular in adult education and for college-level courses. online learning: Lessons are conducted via the internet, with or without an instructor present. It can either supplement or replace in-person learning at every level of education, from prekindergarten through college. Students may complete single lessons or courses online, or in the case of online schools, an entire curriculum. blended learning: Any combination of in-person and online instruction. For example, a student may attend school in person three days a week and receive remote instruction the other two. Explain the term on first use. concurrent instruction or concurrent teaching: When teachers simultaneously instruct both students who are in the classroom and students who are attending remotely. Explain the term on first use. synchronous instruction: Occurs when a teacher engages students online live, in real time. Avoid the term; if used in a direct quotation, explain it. asynchronous instruction: Lacks a live component; lessons and lectures may be prerecorded for students to access online when they choose. Avoid the term; if used in a direct quotation, explain it. virtual school: A school that does not have a physical building; students and teachers interact from separate locations."}

Experts from organizations including the American Medical Association, American Psychiatric Association and American Psychological Association say gender is a spectrum, not a binary structure consisting of only males and females. Sex refers to biological characteristics, such as chromosomes, hormones and reproductive anatomy, which can also vary or change in understanding over time, or be medically and legally altered. Since not all people fall under one of two categories for sex or gender — as in the cases of nonbinary and intersex people — avoid references to both , either or opposite sexes or genders . Relatedly, not all people use gendered pronouns such as his or hers . Such pronouns are often an example of gender expression , but they do not always align with typical or stereotypical expectations of gender and are not certain indicators of someone’s gender identity . Language around gender is ever-evolving. Newsrooms and organizations outside the AP may need to make decisions, based on timing, necessity and audience, on terms that differ from or are not covered by the AP’s specific recommendations. More details and key terms: gender A social construct encompassing a person’s behaviors, self-identity and appearance. Gender often corresponds with but is not synonymous with sex . A person’s sex and gender are usually assigned at birth by parents or attendants and can turn out to be inaccurate.

Often just gender will suffice: She spent a lot of time explaining her gender may work just as well as She spent a lot of time explaining her gender identity . Examples of gender identities include man or boy ; woman or girl ; nonbinary ; bigender ; agender ; gender-fluid ; genderqueer ; and combinations of identities, such as nonbinary woman . See gender ; gender expression ; LGBTQ+ ; nonbinary ; pronouns ; transgender . gender expression How people outwardly convey their gender, intentionally or not, such as through fashion choices, mannerisms or pronouns.

Describes people whose gender does not match the one usually associated with the sex they were assigned at birth. Identify people as transgender only when relevant, and use the name by which they live publicly. Unless it is central to the story, avoid mention of a person’s gender transition or gender-affirmation surgery in news coverage, which can be intrusive and insensitive. Avoid references to a transgender person being born a boy or girl, or phrasing like birth gender . Sex (or gender ) assigned at birth is the accurate terminology. The shorthand trans is acceptable on second reference and in headlines. A person who is assigned female at birth and transitions to align with their identity as a boy or man is a transgender boy or transgender man , and a person who is assigned male at birth and transitions to align with their identity as a girl or woman is a transgender girl or woman .

Do not use as a noun, such as referring to someone as a transgender . Do not use the terms transgendered or transgenderism . Not synonymous with terms like cross-dresser or drag queen . Do not use the outdated term transsexual unless a source specifically asks to be identified as such. Avoid derogatory terms such as tranny . Follow guidelines for obscenities, profanities, vulgarities as appropriate. Refer to a transgender person’s previous name, also called a deadname , only in the rare instance it is relevant to the story. See biological ; deadnaming ; gender-affirming care ; transition , gender transition . cisgender Describes people whose gender identity matches the sex they were assigned at birth; that is, not transgender . Explain if necessary. Do not use terms like normal to describe people who are not transgender . Not synonymous with heterosexual , which refers to sexual orientation . See transgender . deadnaming The practice, widely considered insensitive, offensive or traumatizing, of referring to transgender people who have changed their name by the name they used before their transition. Use a person’s previous name or pretransition image only if required to understand the news or if requested by the person. The terms deadname and deadnaming are best used in direct quotations, when known as a person’s preference, or in broad references, and may require explanation in a story. Phrasing like birth name, legal name or previous name is also acceptable if accurate. The issue of deadnaming often arises when public figures announce a gender transition. In these and other cases, generally use the deadname only once and not in the opening paragraph, with future coverage using only the new name. Deadnaming a transgender person, even posthumously in obituaries or other coverage, can be disrespectful to the deceased, their survivors and any transgender people. In the AP, use of a transgender person’s previous name must be approved by managers. When naming suspects or victims in stories about crimes or accidents, be cognizant that authorities or family members may be ignorant of or be disregarding the person’s wishes about their name or pronouns; when possible, take into account information given by the person or by current friends or others who may have better knowledge about how the person lived and identified. See transgender . transition (n., v.), gender transition The legal, medical or social processes some transgender or nonbinary people undergo to match their gender identity . Examples can include a formal or informal change to names or pronouns, makeup and hairstyles, hormone therapy, or gender-affirmation surgery. Mention or describe it only when relevant. See gender-affirming care ; transgender . gender dysphoria Use this term, not gender identity disorder , for the distress felt when someone’s gender expression does not match their gender identity . It is also a medical diagnosis often required for people to undergo gender-affirmation procedures. gender-affirming care Refers to a swath of mental and medical treatments (such as counseling, hormones or surgery) that help bring a person’s gender expression (such as voice, appearance or anatomy) in line with their gender identity . It can be but is not necessarily part of a gender transition . Such care is not limited to transgender people; it can also serve cisgender, nonbinary or intersex people. If surgery is involved, gender-affirming or gender-affirmation surgery . Do not use the outdated term sex change , and avoid describing someone as pre-op or post-op . Gender-affirming care is the phrasing used by leading medical groups, including the American Medical Association and the American Academy of Pediatrics. Other common phrasing, such as gender-confirming care and gender-confirmation or sex-reassignment surgery , are acceptable in quotations and in proper names. Phrasing like transgender health care and gender-transition surgery is acceptable when the context is confined to transgender people or a gender transition, respectively, but gender-affirming care is best in broader references or when the scope or context is unclear. Do not use abbreviations such as GAS , GCS or SRS unless in quotations, and introduce the full term before the quote. Refer to a person’s gender-affirming surgery only when relevant. See transition ; gender transition ; gender expression ; gender identity . transsexual Some people who have undergone gender-affirming procedures refer to themselves as transsexual ; use the term only if a person requests it. See gender-affirming care . biological A word often best confined to medical or scientific contexts, especially in stories or passages about gender. While sex is a biological feature, terms like biological male, man, female or woman are sometimes used by opponents of transgender rights to portray sex as more simplistic than scientists assert, and to downplay the significance of gender and how it differs from sex . hormones Avoid references to male or female hormones . All humans have varying levels of sex hormones, including testosterone and estrogen. Hormone replacement therapy may be an element of a person’s gender transition . See transition , gender transition . cross-dresser Use this term instead of the outdated transvestite for someone who wears clothing associated with a different gender, and only when the subject identifies as such. Not synonymous with drag performer or transgender . drag performer, drag queen, drag king Entertainers who dress and act as a different gender. Drag queens act as women; drag kings act as men. Male impersonator and female impersonator are also acceptable. Not synonymous with cross-dresser or transgender . sex Refers to biological and physiological characteristics, including but not limited to chromosomes, hormones and reproductive organs. A person’s sex is usually assigned at birth by parents or attendants, sometimes inaccurately. Sex often corresponds with but is not synonymous with gender , which is a social construct. See gender ; hormones ; biological . female, male In general, female and male are adjectives that can describe people of any age and are used only rarely as nouns, such as for a range of ages or an unknown age. The study included males ages 10-21. She is the first female governor of North Carolina. Woman, women, man and men are usually reserved for use as a noun to describe adults, while girl, girls, boy and boys are typically used as a noun for people under age 18. Be aware of nuances and pitfalls in the use of female and woman/women . Since female primarily describes sex, not gender, some people object to its use as a descriptor for women because it can be seen as emphasizing biology and reproductive capacity over gender identity . It can also sometimes carry misogynistic tones that may vary in severity by race, class and other factors. For this reason, woman or women is increasingly common as an adjective. But its use as such can often be awkward, especially if the words man or men would not be used adjectivally in a parallel sense. For instance: He is the only man construction worker on the otherwise all-woman crew is awkward, and He is the only male construction worker on the all otherwise all-woman crew is not parallel. Options for being both sensitive and eloquent include He is the only man on the otherwise all-woman construction crew . Avoid using male and female as modifiers that could convey assumptions about gender roles, such as male nurse, male nanny, female bodybuilder , etc. In general, make a point of someone’s sex or gender only if clearly relevant. See boy, girl ; gender-neutral language . intersex Describes people born with genitalia, chromosomes or reproductive organs that don’t fit typical definitions for males or females. Do not use the outdated term hermaphrodite . Do not conflate with transgender or nonbinary . When relevant, describe the person’s specific condition, along with a brief explanation: Statler has Klinefelter syndrome, in which males have an extra X chromosome . The term difference(s) in sex development is acceptable in quotes and medical contexts; limited use of the abbreviation DSD is acceptable in subsequent references. Avoid the outdated term hermaphrodite . sexual orientation Not sexual preference . Examples include straight or heterosexual, lesbian, gay, bisexual, pansexual and asexual . Mention a person’s sexual orientation only when relevant to the subject matter, and do so only if the information is verified. Avoid references to a gay or alternative lifestyle . Avoid homosexual to describe people, though homosexuality is acceptable as a noun for the concept of same-sex attraction. Gays is acceptable as a plural noun when necessary, but use the singular gay only as an adjective, not as a noun. Lesbian is acceptable as an adjective or as a noun in singular or plural form. Avoid salacious or gratuitous framing like gay lovers or lesbian kiss ; instead use neutral terms like couple or kiss . Transgender is not a sexual orientation. Like anyone, transgender people can have any sexual orientation. See asexual ; bisexual ; LGBTQ+ . LGBTQ+ (adj.) Acceptable in all references for lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender, and queer and/or questioning, plus other sexual and gender minorities . Fewer or additional letters can be used to be more inclusive or in quotations and names of organizations and events, such as LGBT or LGBTQIA . I stands for intersex , and A typically stands for asexual (a person who doesn’t experience sexual attraction). Use of LGBTQ+ is best used as a collective adjective: Walters joined the LGBTQ+ business association . Avoid using LGBTQ+ to describe individuals, and don’t default to LGBTQ+ if discussing a more specific population: a bisexual advocacy group, a transgender health program . When part of a hyphenated compound modifier, drop the plus sign: LGBTQ-related legislation . Follow guidelines for obscenities, profanities, vulgarities as appropriate. See queer ; sexual orientation ; gender identity . queer Many LGBTQ+ people now use the word queer as a point of empowerment to refer to a sexual orientation or gender identity. The term sometimes is used as a synonym for LGBTQ+ . However, because of its origins as a slur, queer is not universally accepted among LGBTQ+ people, and its use tends to be more prevalent among younger generations. Use caution when it isn’t being used to describe the way an individual identifies, in the names of organizations or in a direct quote. When it is meant as a slur, follow guidelines for obscenities, profanities, vulgarities . See LGBTQ+ . asexual Describes people who don’t experience sexual attraction, though they may feel other types of attraction, such as romantic or aesthetic. Not synonymous with and does not assume celibacy. A person’s asexuality can be constant or change over time. See sexual orientation. bisexual Describes attraction to both men and women and now, with the growing recognition of gender as a spectrum, also can more broadly describe attraction to one’s own gender and one or more additional genders. See sexual orientation . “conversion therapy” The scientifically discredited practice of using therapy to “convert” LGBTQ people to heterosexuality or traditional gender expectations.  Include the quotation marks. “Gay conversion therapy” and similar constructions take no hyphen. Gay conversion therapy should take no hyphen. Always include the disclaimer that it is discredited. homophobia, homophobic Acceptable in broad references or in quotations to the concept of fear or hatred of gays, lesbians and bisexuals. The governor denounced homophobia. In individual cases, be specific about observable actions; avoid descriptions or language that assume motives. The leaflets contained an antigay slur. The voters opposed same-sex marriage. Related terms include biphobia (fear or hatred of bisexuals) and transphobia (fear or hatred of transgender people). out, openly The terms out and openly can imply that to identify as LGBTQ is inherently shameful, so use them only when relevant: Xiong is the group’s first out gay president (which would allow for the possibility that previous presidents were gay but not out) or Xiong, who came out at age 29, wishes he had done so sooner . Out is gaining acceptance over openly as a modifier, so consider confining openly to quotations, or ask subjects which term they prefer when relevant and possible. Do not use terms like avowed or admitted . Don’t assume that because news figures address their sexual orientation or gender transition publicly, it qualifies as coming out ; public figures may consider themselves out even if they haven’t previously addressed their identity or orientation publicly. The terms outing or outed are usually used when someone’s identity or orientation is revealed against their knowledge or will. same-sex marriage The preferred term over gay marriage , because it is more inclusive and because the laws generally don’t address sexual orientation. Where legal, same-sex marriages do not differ from other marriages, so the term should be used only when relevant and needed to distinguish from marriages of other couples.

Survivor can denote someone who has lived through an injury or disease, but also can apply to someone who endured a threat but escaped injury altogether. Example: a mass shooting survivor . Likewise, victim can create confusion because it can variously mean someone killed, injured or subjected to mistreatment such as sexual misconduct. Be specific if there is room for confusion: The ceremony honored people wounded in the mass shooting , not The ceremony honored victims and/or survivors of the mass shooting. The play told the story of those killed in the hurricane , not The play told the stories of the hurricane’s victims. Also be alert to potential biases and assumptions inherent in the word victim . A phrase such as AIDS victim , for instance, not only makes it unclear whether the subject is alive or dead, but many AIDS patients do not consider themselves victims. Instead, use neutral, precise descriptions: He has AIDS. She has hepatitis. In crime stories, avoid alleged victim if possible; it is too easily construed as skepticism. In stories in which sexual misconduct or other allegations are leveled, consider calling the person making the allegations an accuser instead of a victim if shorthand is needed, to avoid implications of guilt on the part of the accused. Survivor is often used to describe people who have lived through physical or emotional trauma, as in abuse or rape survivor . It is best to be specific when referring to individuals, especially if the person was never in danger of death. Use of survivor gets more latitude when describing groups.

{"source_url": "https://www.apstylebook.com/ap_stylebook/suicide", "entry_header": "suicide", "text_content": "Generally, AP does not cover a suicide or suicide attempt, unless the person is well known or the circumstances are particularly unusual or publicly disruptive. Avoid using the phrase committed suicide , which can imply a criminal act. Alternative phrases include killed himself, took her own life or died by suicide . Generally avoid any such phrasing in headlines, unless the circumstances were very public. Suicide stories, when published, should not go into detail on methods used. Often, it may not be necessary to say anything other than that the person died by suicide. Suicide prevention experts believe, based on experience and some studies, that the less said in the media about the methods of suicide, the less likelihood that a death will prompt at-risk people from taking their lives by that same method in the days immediately after. If police or family members announce publicly the method of a suicide, it is acceptable in some circumstances to report that. But do not specify the method in the headline or lead, and do not go into specific details, such as the type of gun or other means used. If the method is not initially announced but becomes public later, consider whether a story noting the method is necessary at all. If such a story is done, keep the details out of the headline and lead. Notes or letters are another area for caution. Generally avoid reporting the contents. Experts say there generally is not a simple explanation or a single reason behind a suicide, so avoid wording or framing that suggests or points to a single cause. Discussion of general causes or concerns, such as the effects of the coronavirus pandemic on mental health, in broader stories about suicide may be appropriate. But consider carefully whether a broad story on some topics, such an unusually high number of suicides at one high school, is justified when weighed against a potential contagion effect. Apply judgment involved with suicide coverage also to murder-suicides. Considerations may include the prominence of those involved and whether there was a threat to public safety. Do not post video or other imagery of suicide attempts or completed suicides. Do not refer to an unsuccessful suicide attempt . Refer instead to an attempted suicide , and use this information only if a story is merited under the above guidelines. Suicide prevention experts recommend including in U.S. stories the 988 Suicide and Crisis Lifeline: Call or text 988 or chat at 988Lifeline.org. In AP stories, those details should be included in a publishable editor’s note, generally within the first five paragraphs of the story. For example: EDITOR’S NOTE — In the U.S., the national suicide and crisis lifeline is available by calling or texting 988. There is also an online chat at 988lifeline.org Or: EDITOR’S NOTE — This story includes discussion of suicide. If you or someone you know needs help, the national suicide and crisis lifeline in the U.S. is available by calling or texting 988. There is also an online chat at 988lifeline.org Outside the U.S., use similar language and format for resources that meet general AP standards such as impartiality.

{"source_url": "https://www.apstylebook.com/ap_stylebook/weapons", "entry_header": "firearms, guns, assault weapons", "text_content": "Assault weapon is a political term that is often used by state and federal lawmakers to refer to types of semiautomatic rifles with certain features. States with assault weapons bans have varying definitions, but they generally refer to semiautomatic firearms with features such as a detachable magazine, pistol grip, a folding or detachable stock, or a threaded barrel. The terms assault weapons or assault rifles may be used in headlines and in first reference in a story because that is how the group of firearms has become commonly known. But high in the story, give specifics. For example: certain semiautomatic rifles referred to as assault weapons , or certain semiautomatic rifles commonly called assault weapons . Be as specific as possible about the types of guns at issue in any given law or story. Use the terms AR- or AK-style rifles when accurate. AR stands for Armalite Rifle , a nod to the company that designed the first one. AR-style rifles , the most common being the AR-15 style, are now made by numerous companies. AK-style is a different type of rifle based on the design of Mikhail Kalashnikova, the original creator of the AK-47 . Do not refer to assault weapons bans as bans on semiautomatic weapons , which encompasses many modern firearms not classified as assault weapons. Avoid the terms military-style rifles or modern sporting rifles . When reporting on guns, do not automatically repeat terms used by authorities, witnesses or others. Witnesses will often misinterpret the sound of a rapidly fired gun or base a description on the look of the weapon. Instead, seek specific and detailed information from authorities, such as a gun’s make, model, caliber and magazine capacity. For example, Authorities said the shooter used a Smith & Wesson M&P15 rifle or Authorities said the man used an AR-style semiautomatic rifle with a 30-round magazine . Use more generalized descriptions, such as rifle or handgun , until such details become available. Under federal law, automatic rifles are restricted in the United States to their manufacturers; licensed dealers; the military; law enforcement; and civilians who have special permission to own such weapons, provided that the weapons were imported or domestically manufactured before May 19, 1986. Other terms: anti-aircraft A cannon or other weapon designed for defense against air attack. The form: a 105 mm anti-aircraft gun . artillery A carriage-mounted cannon. automatic A firearm that reloads automatically after each shot. The term should not be used to describe the rate of fire. To avoid confusion, specify fully automatic or semiautomatic rather than simply automatic. Give the type of weapon or model for clarity. bolt-action rifle A manually operated handle on the barrel opens and closes the breech, ejecting a spent round, loading another and cocking the weapon for triggering. Popular for hunting and target-shooting. Example: Remington 700 . Some shotguns are bolt-action. buckshot See shot . bullet The projectile fired by a rifle, pistol or machine gun. Together with metal casing, primer and propellant, it forms a cartridge . caliber A measurement of the diameter of the inside of a gun barrel except for most shotguns. Measurement is in either millimeters or decimal fractions of an inch. The word caliber is not used when giving the metric measurement. The forms: a 9 mm pistol, a .22-caliber rifle . cannon A weapon, usually supported on some type of carriage, that fires explosive projectiles. The form: a 105 mm cannon . Plural is cannons . carbine A short, lightweight rifle, usually having a barrel length of less than 20 inches. The form: an M3 carbine . cartridge See bullet . clip Do not use this term unless in a quote. The correct term is magazine to describe the device used to store multiple rounds of ammunition together as a unit, ready for insertion into a firearm. A clip is a device that stores rounds together that can then be used to load bullets into a magazine . See magazine for a fuller description. Colt Named for Samuel Colt, it designates a make of weapon or ammunition developed for Colt handguns. The forms: a Colt .45-caliber revolver, .45 Colt ammunition . fully automatic A firearm that fires continuously as long as the trigger is depressed. Examples include machine guns and submachine guns . gauge The measure of the size of a shotgun. Gauge is expressed in terms of the number per pound of round lead balls with a diameter equal to the size of the barrel. The bigger the number, the smaller the shotgun. The forms: a 12-gauge shotgun, a .410 shotgun . The .410 actually is a caliber, but commonly is called a gauge. The ball leaving the barrel is 0.41” in diameter. ghost guns Privately made firearms that lack serial numbers used to trace them and are often purchased without a background check. Law enforcement officials have reported ghost guns have increasingly been used in violent crimes across the U.S. Avoid describing them as untraceable guns and instead say they are harder for law enforcement to trace. handgun A pistol or a revolver . howitzer A cannon shorter than a gun of the same caliber employed to fire projectiles at relatively high angles at a target, such as opposing forces behind a ridge. The form: a 105 mm howitzer . lever-action rifle A handle on the stock ejects and loads cartridges and cocks the rifle for triggering. A firearm often associated with the Old West. Example: Winchester 94 . M1, M16 These and similar combinations of a letter and figure(s) designate rifles used by the military. The forms: an M1 rifle, an M16 rifle . machine gun A fully automatic gun that fires as long as the trigger is depressed and bullets are chambered. Such a weapon is generally so large and heavy that it rests on the ground or a mount. A submachine gun is hand-held. The form: a .50-caliber Browning machine gun . magazine The ammunition storage and feeding device within or attached to a firearm. It may be fixed to the firearm or detachable. It is not a clip . Magnum A trademark for a type of high-powered cartridge with a larger case and a larger powder charge than other cartridges of approximately the same caliber. The form: a .357 Magnum, a .44 Magnum . mortar Device used to launch a mortar shell; it is the shell, not the mortar, that is fired. musket A heavy, large-caliber shoulder firearm fired by means of a matchlock, a wheel lock, a flintlock or a percussion lock. Its ammunition is a musket ball. pistol A handgun that can be a single-shot or a semiautomatic. Differs from a revolver in that the chamber and barrel are one integral part. Its size is measured in calibers. The form: a .45-caliber pistol . revolver A handgun. Differs from a pistol in that cartridges are held in chambers in a cylinder that revolves through the barrel. The form: a .45-caliber revolver . rifle A firearm designed or made to be fired from the shoulder and having a rifled bore. It uses bullets or cartridges for ammunition. Its size is measured in calibers. The form: a .22-caliber rifle . Saturday night special A compact, relatively inexpensive handgun. semiautomatic A firearm that fires only once for each pull of the trigger. It reloads after each shot. The form: a semiautomatic rifle, a semiautomatic weapon, a semiautomatic pistol . shell The word applies to military or naval ammunition and to shotgun ammunition. For small arms, bullet or round is the common term for ammunition. shot Small lead or steel pellets fired by shotguns. A shotgun shell usually contains 1 to 2 ounces of shot. Do not use shot interchangeably with buckshot , which refers only to the largest shot sizes. shotgun A firearm typically used to fire small spherical pellets called shot. Shotguns usually have a smooth bore barrel, but some contain a rifled barrel, which is used to fire a single projectile. Size is measured according to gauge, except for the .410, which is measured according to caliber, meaning the ball leaving the barrel is 0.41” in diameter. The form: a 12-gauge shotgun, a .410 shotgun . silencer, suppressor A device that muffles the sound of a firearm. They are colloquially known as silencers but are more accurately referred to as suppressors . The device reduces the sound a gun makes when it’s fired but does not eliminate the sound. They generally lower the sound level by 20 to 35 decibels, making most firearms still louder than the average ambulance siren. For clarity, describe the device as a firearm suppressor , and note that it is generally known in generic terms as a silencer . To legally purchase the device, it must be bought from a licensed dealer and the buyer must undergo an extensive background check. The background check, similar to what is required to purchase fully automatic weapons, is tightly regulated under the National Firearms Act of 1934. Each suppressor carries a serial number that can be tracked. Suppressors were invented in the early 1900s by MIT-educated Hiram Percy Maxim, who invented a muffler for gasoline engines. The devices were brought under National Firearms Act regulations after Depression-era game wardens were concerned hunters would use them to poach. submachine gun A lightweight fully automatic gun firing handgun ammunition."}

Follow these guidelines to determine when it should be included and in what form: SPECIFY THE TIME: Whenever it gives the reader a better picture of the scene: Did the earthquake occur when people were likely to be home asleep or at work? A clock reading for the time in the datelined community is acceptable although predawn hours or rush hour often is more illustrative. Whenever the time is critical to the story: When will the rocket be launched? When will a major political address be broadcast? What is the deadline for meeting a demand? DECIDING ON CLOCK TIME: When giving a clock reading, use the time in the datelined community. If the story has no dateline, use the clock time in force where the event happened or will take place. The only exception is a nationwide story or tabular listing that involves television or radio programs. Always use Eastern time, followed by EDT or EST , and specify whether the program will be broadcast simultaneously nationwide or whether times will vary because of separate transmissions for different time zones. If practical, specify those times in a separate paragraph. ZONE ABBREVIATIONS: Use EST, CDT, PST , etc., after a clock time only if: The story involves travel or other activities, such as the closing hour for polling places or the time of a televised speech, likely to affect people or developments in more than one time zone. The item involves television or radio programs. (See above.) The item has no dateline. The item is an advisory to editors. C ONVERT TO EASTERN TIME? Do not convert clock times from other time zones in the continental United States to Eastern time. If there is high interest in the precise time, add CDT, PST , etc., to the local reading to help readers determine their equivalent local time. If the time is critical in a story from outside the continental United States, provide a conversion to Eastern time using this form: The kidnappers set a 9 a.m. (3 a.m. EDT) deadline. See time zones for additional guidance on forms."}

Use Monday, Tuesday , etc., for days of the week within seven days before or after the current date. Use the month and a figure where appropriate. See months for forms and punctuation. Avoid such redundancies as last Tuesday or next Tuesday . The past, present or future tense used for the verb usually provides adequate indication of which Tuesday is meant: He said he finished the job Tuesday. She will return Tuesday. Avoid awkward placements of the time element, particularly those that suggest the day of the week is the object of a transitive verb: The police jailed Tuesday. Potential remedies include the use of the word on (see the on entry), rephrasing the sentence, or placing the time element in a different sentence. See today, tonight for further discussion, including usage other than in news stories."}

{"source_url": "https://www.apstylebook.com/ap_stylebook/pronouns", "entry_header": "pronouns", "text_content": "Growing numbers of people, including some transgender, nonbinary, agender or gender-fluid people, use they/them/their as a gender-neutral singular personal pronoun. As much as possible, AP also uses they/them/their as a way of accurately describing and representing a person who uses those pronouns for themself. Here are some guidelines and perspectives. They as a singular pronoun may be confusing to some readers and amount to a roadblock that stops them from reading further. At the same time, though, efforts to write without pronouns to avoid confusion may make people feel censored or invisible. How to balance those priorities? Try to honor both your readers and your story subjects. As in all news writing, clarity is paramount. Often a sentence can be sensitively and smoothly written with no pronoun. For example: Hendricks said the new job is a thrill (instead of Hendricks said Hendricks is thrilled about the new job or Hendricks said they are thrilled about the new job ). When using they/them/their as a singular pronoun, explain if it isn’t clear in context: Morales, who uses the pronoun they, said they will retire in June . Be sure that the phrasing does not imply more than one person. Rephrase if needed to avoid confusion about the antecedent. Don’t refer to preferred or chosen pronouns. Instead, the pronouns they use, whose pronouns are, who uses the pronouns , etc. Don’t make assumptions about a person’s gender identity based on their pronouns, or vice versa. Don’t assume a person’s pronouns based on their first name. In general, do not use neopronouns such as xe or zim ; they are rarely used and are unrecognizable as words to general audiences. They/them/their take plural verbs even when used as a singular pronoun, and the singular reflexive themself is also acceptable when referring to people who use they/them/their . — Do not presume maleness in constructing a sentence by defaulting to he/his/him . When necessary, use they rather than he/she or he or she for an unspecified or unknown gender ( a person, the victim, the winner ) or indefinite pronoun ( anyone, everyone, someone ). But rewording to avoid a pronoun is preferable. For example: The foundation gave grants to anyone who lost a job this year (instead of anyone who lost their job ). A singular they may also be used when an anonymous source’s gender must be shielded: The person feared for their own safety and spoke on condition of anonymity ."}

Experts from organizations including the American Medical Association, American Psychiatric Association and American Psychological Association say gender is a spectrum, not a binary structure consisting of only males and females. Sex refers to biological characteristics, such as chromosomes, hormones and reproductive anatomy, which can also vary or change in understanding over time, or be medically and legally altered. Since not all people fall under one of two categories for sex or gender — as in the cases of nonbinary and intersex people — avoid references to both , either or opposite sexes or genders . Relatedly, not all people use gendered pronouns such as his or hers . Such pronouns are often an example of gender expression , but they do not always align with typical or stereotypical expectations of gender and are not certain indicators of someone’s gender identity . Language around gender is ever-evolving. Newsrooms and organizations outside the AP may need to make decisions, based on timing, necessity and audience, on terms that differ from or are not covered by the AP’s specific recommendations. More details and key terms: gender A social construct encompassing a person’s behaviors, self-identity and appearance. Gender often corresponds with but is not synonymous with sex . A person’s sex and gender are usually assigned at birth by parents or attendants and can turn out to be inaccurate. Experts from organizations including the American Medical Association, American Psychiatric Association and American Psychological Association say gender is a spectrum, not a binary structure consisting of only males and females. See gender expression ; gender identity ; sex ; transgender . gender identity A person’s sense of feeling male, female, neither or some combination of both. Often just gender will suffice: She spent a lot of time explaining her gender may work just as well as She spent a lot of time explaining her gender identity . Examples of gender identities include man or boy ; woman or girl ; nonbinary ; bigender ; agender ; gender-fluid ; genderqueer ; and combinations of identities, such as nonbinary woman . See gender ; gender expression ; LGBTQ+ ; nonbinary ; pronouns ; transgender . gender expression How people outwardly convey their gender, intentionally or not, such as through fashion choices, mannerisms or pronouns. Gender stereotypes can lead others to incorrectly perceive someone’s gender or sexual orientation . See gender identity ; gender-nonconforming ; pronouns . gender-fluid, gender-fluidity Refers to a gender identity or expression that changes over time. Include the hyphen. gender-nonconforming (adj.) Gender-nonconforming is acceptable in broad references to describe people whose identities or expressions do not follow gender norms. The term gender-expansive is similar but carries a connotation of flexibility and exploration of one’s gender identity. Both terms may include but are not synonymous with transgender . Avoid dated terminology such as gender-bending or tomboy . genderqueer (adj.) An identity describing people whose gender expression does not follow norms; use only if the person or group identifies as such. Not synonymous with nonbinary . nonbinary (adj.) Describes people who don’t identify as strictly male or female ; can include agender (having no gender), gender-fluid (an identity that fluctuates) or a combination of male and female. Not synonymous with transgender , though some nonbinary people are also transgender . See gender expression ; gender identity ; pronouns . pronouns See the separate pronouns entry. transgender (adj.) Describes people whose gender does not match the one usually associated with the sex they were assigned at birth. Identify people as transgender only when relevant, and use the name by which they live publicly. Unless it is central to the story, avoid mention of a person’s gender transition or gender-affirmation surgery in news coverage, which can be intrusive and insensitive. Avoid references to a transgender person being born a boy or girl, or phrasing like birth gender . Sex (or gender ) assigned at birth is the accurate terminology. The shorthand trans is acceptable on second reference and in headlines. A person who is assigned female at birth and transitions to align with their identity as a boy or man is a transgender boy or transgender man , and a person who is assigned male at birth and transitions to align with their identity as a girl or woman is a transgender girl or woman . Avoid the one-word compounds transman and transwoman . Instead, when relevant, say transgender man or transgender woman . In subsequent references, trans man or trans woman are acceptable. Do not use as a noun, such as referring to someone as a transgender . Do not use the terms transgendered or transgenderism . Not synonymous with terms like cross-dresser or drag queen . Do not use the outdated term transsexual unless a source specifically asks to be identified as such. Avoid derogatory terms such as tranny . Follow guidelines for obscenities, profanities, vulgarities as appropriate. Refer to a transgender person’s previous name, also called a deadname , only in the rare instance it is relevant to the story. See biological ; deadnaming ; gender-affirming care ; transition , gender transition . cisgender Describes people whose gender identity matches the sex they were assigned at birth; that is, not transgender . Explain if necessary. Do not use terms like normal to describe people who are not transgender . Not synonymous with heterosexual , which refers to sexual orientation . See transgender . deadnaming The practice, widely considered insensitive, offensive or traumatizing, of referring to transgender people who have changed their name by the name they used before their transition. Use a person’s previous name or pretransition image only if required to understand the news or if requested by the person. The terms deadname and deadnaming are best used in direct quotations, when known as a person’s preference, or in broad references, and may require explanation in a story. Phrasing like birth name, legal name or previous name is also acceptable if accurate. The issue of deadnaming often arises when public figures announce a gender transition. In these and other cases, generally use the deadname only once and not in the opening paragraph, with future coverage using only the new name. Deadnaming a transgender person, even posthumously in obituaries or other coverage, can be disrespectful to the deceased, their survivors and any transgender people. In the AP, use of a transgender person’s previous name must be approved by managers. When naming suspects or victims in stories about crimes or accidents, be cognizant that authorities or family members may be ignorant of or be disregarding the person’s wishes about their name or pronouns; when possible, take into account information given by the person or by current friends or others who may have better knowledge about how the person lived and identified. See transgender . transition (n., v.), gender transition The legal, medical or social processes some transgender or nonbinary people undergo to match their gender identity . Examples can include a formal or informal change to names or pronouns, makeup and hairstyles, hormone therapy, or gender-affirmation surgery. Mention or describe it only when relevant. See gender-affirming care ; transgender . gender dysphoria Use this term, not gender identity disorder , for the distress felt when someone’s gender expression does not match their gender identity . It is also a medical diagnosis often required for people to undergo gender-affirmation procedures. gender-affirming care Refers to a swath of mental and medical treatments (such as counseling, hormones or surgery) that help bring a person’s gender expression (such as voice, appearance or anatomy) in line with their gender identity . It can be but is not necessarily part of a gender transition . Such care is not limited to transgender people; it can also serve cisgender, nonbinary or intersex people. If surgery is involved, gender-affirming or gender-affirmation surgery . Do not use the outdated term sex change , and avoid describing someone as pre-op or post-op . Gender-affirming care is the phrasing used by leading medical groups, including the American Medical Association and the American Academy of Pediatrics. Other common phrasing, such as gender-confirming care and gender-confirmation or sex-reassignment surgery , are acceptable in quotations and in proper names. Phrasing like transgender health care and gender-transition surgery is acceptable when the context is confined to transgender people or a gender transition, respectively, but gender-affirming care is best in broader references or when the scope or context is unclear. Do not use abbreviations such as GAS , GCS or SRS unless in quotations, and introduce the full term before the quote. Refer to a person’s gender-affirming surgery only when relevant. See transition ; gender transition ; gender expression ; gender identity . transsexual Some people who have undergone gender-affirming procedures refer to themselves as transsexual ; use the term only if a person requests it. See gender-affirming care . biological A word often best confined to medical or scientific contexts, especially in stories or passages about gender. While sex is a biological feature, terms like biological male, man, female or woman are sometimes used by opponents of transgender rights to portray sex as more simplistic than scientists assert, and to downplay the significance of gender and how it differs from sex . hormones Avoid references to male or female hormones . All humans have varying levels of sex hormones, including testosterone and estrogen. Hormone replacement therapy may be an element of a person’s gender transition . See transition , gender transition . cross-dresser Use this term instead of the outdated transvestite for someone who wears clothing associated with a different gender, and only when the subject identifies as such. Not synonymous with drag performer or transgender . drag performer, drag queen, drag king Entertainers who dress and act as a different gender. Drag queens act as women; drag kings act as men. Male impersonator and female impersonator are also acceptable. Not synonymous with cross-dresser or transgender . sex Refers to biological and physiological characteristics, including but not limited to chromosomes, hormones and reproductive organs. A person’s sex is usually assigned at birth by parents or attendants, sometimes inaccurately. Sex often corresponds with but is not synonymous with gender , which is a social construct. See gender ; hormones ; biological . female, male In general, female and male are adjectives that can describe people of any age and are used only rarely as nouns, such as for a range of ages or an unknown age. The study included males ages 10-21. She is the first female governor of North Carolina. Woman, women, man and men are usually reserved for use as a noun to describe adults, while girl, girls, boy and boys are typically used as a noun for people under age 18. Be aware of nuances and pitfalls in the use of female and woman/women . Since female primarily describes sex, not gender, some people object to its use as a descriptor for women because it can be seen as emphasizing biology and reproductive capacity over gender identity . It can also sometimes carry misogynistic tones that may vary in severity by race, class and other factors. For this reason, woman or women is increasingly common as an adjective. But its use as such can often be awkward, especially if the words man or men would not be used adjectivally in a parallel sense. For instance: He is the only man construction worker on the otherwise all-woman crew is awkward, and He is the only male construction worker on the all otherwise all-woman crew is not parallel. Options for being both sensitive and eloquent include He is the only man on the otherwise all-woman construction crew . Avoid using male and female as modifiers that could convey assumptions about gender roles, such as male nurse, male nanny, female bodybuilder , etc. In general, make a point of someone’s sex or gender only if clearly relevant. See boy, girl ; gender-neutral language . intersex Describes people born with genitalia, chromosomes or reproductive organs that don’t fit typical definitions for males or females. Do not use the outdated term hermaphrodite . Do not conflate with transgender or nonbinary . When relevant, describe the person’s specific condition, along with a brief explanation: Statler has Klinefelter syndrome, in which males have an extra X chromosome . The term difference(s) in sex development is acceptable in quotes and medical contexts; limited use of the abbreviation DSD is acceptable in subsequent references. Avoid the outdated term hermaphrodite . sexual orientation Not sexual preference . Examples include straight or heterosexual, lesbian, gay, bisexual, pansexual and asexual . Mention a person’s sexual orientation only when relevant to the subject matter, and do so only if the information is verified. Avoid references to a gay or alternative lifestyle . Avoid homosexual to describe people, though homosexuality is acceptable as a noun for the concept of same-sex attraction. Gays is acceptable as a plural noun when necessary, but use the singular gay only as an adjective, not as a noun. Lesbian is acceptable as an adjective or as a noun in singular or plural form. Avoid salacious or gratuitous framing like gay lovers or lesbian kiss ; instead use neutral terms like couple or kiss . Transgender is not a sexual orientation. Like anyone, transgender people can have any sexual orientation. See asexual ; bisexual ; LGBTQ+ . LGBTQ+ (adj.) Acceptable in all references for lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender, and queer and/or questioning, plus other sexual and gender minorities . Fewer or additional letters can be used to be more inclusive or in quotations and names of organizations and events, such as LGBT or LGBTQIA . I stands for intersex , and A typically stands for asexual (a person who doesn’t experience sexual attraction). Use of LGBTQ+ is best used as a collective adjective: Walters joined the LGBTQ+ business association . Avoid using LGBTQ+ to describe individuals, and don’t default to LGBTQ+ if discussing a more specific population: a bisexual advocacy group, a transgender health program . When part of a hyphenated compound modifier, drop the plus sign: LGBTQ-related legislation . Follow guidelines for obscenities, profanities, vulgarities as appropriate. See queer ; sexual orientation ; gender identity . queer Many LGBTQ+ people now use the word queer as a point of empowerment to refer to a sexual orientation or gender identity. The term sometimes is used as a synonym for LGBTQ+ . However, because of its origins as a slur, queer is not universally accepted among LGBTQ+ people, and its use tends to be more prevalent among younger generations. Use caution when it isn’t being used to describe the way an individual identifies, in the names of organizations or in a direct quote. When it is meant as a slur, follow guidelines for obscenities, profanities, vulgarities . See LGBTQ+ . asexual Describes people who don’t experience sexual attraction, though they may feel other types of attraction, such as romantic or aesthetic. Not synonymous with and does not assume celibacy. A person’s asexuality can be constant or change over time. See sexual orientation. bisexual Describes attraction to both men and women and now, with the growing recognition of gender as a spectrum, also can more broadly describe attraction to one’s own gender and one or more additional genders. See sexual orientation . “conversion therapy” The scientifically discredited practice of using therapy to “convert” LGBTQ people to heterosexuality or traditional gender expectations.  Include the quotation marks. “Gay conversion therapy” and similar constructions take no hyphen. Gay conversion therapy should take no hyphen. Always include the disclaimer that it is discredited. homophobia, homophobic Acceptable in broad references or in quotations to the concept of fear or hatred of gays, lesbians and bisexuals. The governor denounced homophobia. In individual cases, be specific about observable actions; avoid descriptions or language that assume motives. The leaflets contained an antigay slur. The voters opposed same-sex marriage. Related terms include biphobia (fear or hatred of bisexuals) and transphobia (fear or hatred of transgender people). out, openly The terms out and openly can imply that to identify as LGBTQ is inherently shameful, so use them only when relevant: Xiong is the group’s first out gay president (which would allow for the possibility that previous presidents were gay but not out) or Xiong, who came out at age 29, wishes he had done so sooner . Out is gaining acceptance over openly as a modifier, so consider confining openly to quotations, or ask subjects which term they prefer when relevant and possible. Do not use terms like avowed or admitted . Don’t assume that because news figures address their sexual orientation or gender transition publicly, it qualifies as coming out ; public figures may consider themselves out even if they haven’t previously addressed their identity or orientation publicly. The terms outing or outed are usually used when someone’s identity or orientation is revealed against their knowledge or will. same-sex marriage The preferred term over gay marriage , because it is more inclusive and because the laws generally don’t address sexual orientation. Where legal, same-sex marriages do not differ from other marriages, so the term should be used only when relevant and needed to distinguish from marriages of other couples.

Spell out and lowercase representative and senator in other uses. Spell out other legislative titles in all uses. Capitalize formal titles such as chair, city councilor, delegate , etc., when they are used before a name. Lowercase in other uses. Add U.S. or state before a title only if necessary to avoid confusion: Former state Attorney General Dan Sullivan, a Republican, defeated U.S. Sen. Mark Begich, a Democrat from Alaska, during the 2014 general election. In stories with international datelines, include U.S. before legislative titles. FIRST-REFERENCE PRACTICE: The use of a title such as Rep. or Sen. in first reference is normal in most stories. It is not mandatory, however, provided an individual’s title is given later in the story. Deletion of the title on first reference is frequently appropriate, for example, when an individual has become well known: Barack Obama declared Americans were ready to “cast aside cynicism” as he looked for a convincing win in the Democratic contest. The Illinois senator was leading in the polls. SECOND REFERENCE: Do not use legislative titles before a name on second reference unless they are part of a direct quotation. CONGRESSMAN, CONGRESSWOMAN: Rep. and U.S. Rep. are the preferred first-reference forms when a formal title is used before the name of a U.S. House member. In stand-alone references, the terms U.S. House representative, representative, member of Congress are preferred. Congressman and congresswoman are acceptable. Do not use congressperson . Congressman and congresswoman should appear as capitalized formal titles before a name only in direct quotation. ORGANIZATIONAL TITLES: Capitalize titles for formal, organizational offices within a legislative body when they are used before a name: House Speaker Paul Ryan, Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi, House Minority Whip Steny Hoyer, President Pro Tem Orrin Hatch, Senate Judiciary Committee Chairman Charles Grassley.

Both types of clauses provide additional information about a word or phrase in the sentence. The difference between them is that the essential clause cannot be eliminated without changing the meaning of the sentence  it so restricts the meaning of the word or phrase that its absence would lead to a substantially different interpretation of what the author meant. The nonessential clause , however, can be eliminated without altering the basic meaning of the sentence  it does not restrict the meaning so significantly that its absence would radically alter the author's thought. PUNCTUATION: An essential clause must not be set off from the rest of a sentence by commas. A nonessential clause must be set off by commas. The presence or absence of commas provides the reader with critical information about the writer's intended meaning. Note the following examples:  Reporters who do not read the Stylebook should not criticize their editors. (The writer is saying that only one class of reporters, those who do not read the Stylebook, should not criticize their editors. If the who ... Stylebook phrase were deleted, the meaning of the sentence would be changed substantially.)  Reporters, who do not read the Stylebook, should not criticize their editors. (The writer is saying that all reporters should not criticize their editors. If the who ... Stylebook phrase were deleted, this meaning would not be changed.) USE OF WHO, WHOM, THAT, WHICH: See separate entries on that (conjunction) ; that, which (pronouns) ; who, whom . That is the preferred pronoun to introduce essential clauses that refer to an inanimate object or an animal without a name. Which is the only acceptable pronoun to introduce a nonessential clause that refers to an inanimate object or an animal without a name. The pronoun which occasionally may be substituted for that in the introduction of an essential clause that refers to an inanimate object or an animal without a name. In general, this use of which should appear only when that is used as a conjunction to introduce another clause in the same sentence: He said Monday that the part of the army which suffered severe casualties needs reinforcement. See that (conjunction) for guidelines on the use of that as a conjunction."}

Do not confuse with watt-hour , a unit of energy used to describe electricity consumed or generated over time. A watt is often used to describe the peak or maximum capacity of an electric device, like a light bulb or a power generator. Think of it as a snapshot of a level of electric power at any moment. Common variants include kilowatt , (1,000 watts), megawatt (1 million watts) and gigawatt (1 billion watts). Abbreviations are W, kW, MW, GW . Watt-hours are used to measure power over time. One watt-hour is one watt of power over one hour. Most people pay for electricity by the kilowatt-hour. Variants are megawatt-hours and gigawatt-hours . Abbreviations are Wh, kWh, MWh, GWh . News releases about power plants usually speak of a plant's power in megawatts. However, this is usually just a reference to the plant's peak power. Power plants, particularly those that rely on renewable resources such as sun or wind, don't generate power at peak rates consistently. The best way to describe a plant's practical ability to generate electricity is to multiply its peak capacity in kilowatts or megawatts by the plant's capacity factor (a percentage that yields the average amount of power actually produced by the plant, rather than what it produces just at peak moments). To determine how many homes can be powered by a plant, multiply the peak power by the capacity factor, then multiply by 8,760 (the number of hours in a year), then divide that by the average consumption of a home over a year in kilowatt hours. In the United States, an average home consumes about 11,000 kWh per year. Another common unit of power is horsepower. One kilowatt equals 1.34 horsepower."}

Zika is primarily spread by a type of tropical mosquito called Aedes aegypti, which can pick up the virus from an infected person’s blood. It also can be transmitted by sex. There are no treatments; testing of some experimental vaccines is underway. The virus is closely related to the dengue and yellow fever viruses.

But with this bonanza of opportunity comes unique responsibility. A misleading or incorrect story could lead someone to make unwise, harmful choices. It’s impossible to be too careful, yet there’s no need to fear these topics, either. The skills that make for good science or medical writing are the same as those for good reporting on any topic. Chief among them is critical thinking: to question rather than accept a claim, to check what’s already been written about it, to ask for evidence to evaluate the claim and to seek the help of experts to put it into context. Is it the first treatment for a disease or the fifth? The biggest rise in average temperature in a decade or the ninth? Does it change what scientists have long understood? Anyone can write a recap of results. The journalist’s job is to help readers understand what they mean. CHOOSING STORIES News stories are aimed at the public, not at scientists, doctors, investors or policymakers. They must be useful to general readers and written in clear language free of jargon. In health and medicine, topics that affect a lot of people appeal to a larger audience than those that affect a few (heart disease versus a rare disease) unless there’s a great human interest story or major advance that makes it newsworthy. In science, advances that help further understanding of our world (or distant worlds) in ways that can be made relevant or interesting to general readers can be worth covering. Also worthy of coverage are stories that hold some other special appeal because of the subject or scientific approach. News stories should have value for readers, not just give credit to a researcher, university or hospital. A good test: whether it would be talked about at the dinner table.\nWhen initially evaluating potential stories, here are things to look for, and to look out for: Important science usually is made public in journals or at scientific meetings where a researcher’s methods and results have been deemed acceptable by outside experts (a process called peer review). That gives their findings more credibility, though rigorous checking by reporters is still essential. Reputable scientists rarely announce their findings solely in a news release or at a news conference. Consider the source. Is it from an established research institution? A large, reputable journal, or one without peer review? Off-the-beaten-path places and minor journals can have good science, but reporting on it requires even more care than usual. Reports conducted by advocacy and industry groups, even though many employ accomplished scientists, should be treated with caution. That research is generally designed to make a point, not to look for an answer objectively. Beware of “breakthroughs” because few things truly are. Exaggeration makes readers and viewers distrust the media and science. Be skeptical of “first” and “only,” and use these words only when you’re sure they’re true. It’s often difficult or impossible to verify that something is a first. Or it may be a first for a certain research institution or hospital yet has been done elsewhere, or it’s an incremental step that’s technically a first but in reality is of small import. Be skeptical of health claims based on testimonials or anecdotes. They are not science. Many people ascribe benefits to something when it is really a placebo effect — when a person responds to a dummy treatment. Conversely, many people also ascribe their health problems to something without any way to know if that is truly the cause. Readers are not served well from one person’s belief, experience or understanding of the effectiveness or safety of a treatment, a medical device, a diet or a chemical. Keep in mind that scientists are not infallible. They are human, with their own biases, and can make mistakes even when they’re very careful. SCIENTIFIC JOURNALS, MEETINGS AND EMBARGOES Science and medical journals are written for scientists, researchers and doctors, offering professionals in the field findings that further research can build on. Sometimes these findings are important or interesting enough for general readers. These are usually published in major journals and provided several days in advance under embargo to registered journalists to allow time to prepare stories and consult experts. Understand, however, that institutions use embargoes to drum up interest. Science happens continuously, not just when journals or universities announce findings. Avoid embargoes that do not allow you to speak to sources outside of the institution that is promoting their work. Never use information obtained under embargo for any other purpose besides journalism. Do not discuss with family, friends or others while the information is under embargo. Drug company stocks rise and fall on such news, and journalists can be liable like anyone else if insider trading happens because of improper or premature disclosure of results. There are thousands of journals, some with more rigorous standards than others. Research that has not been peer-reviewed, including articles posted on preprint servers, should be reported with extreme care. Even studies published in respected peer-reviewed journals require journalistic vetting with experts unconnected with the research because the process of peer review is not foolproof. Research sometimes is presented first at scientific or medical conferences and meetings. Coverage of this research requires extra care because often only partial results are released and they haven’t been subjected to full peer review. If reporting findings presented at meetings, it’s best to be there in person so you can consult outside experts who have seen the presentation. TYPES OF STUDIES How a study was done helps determine how reliable its results are. Here are things to consider about some common study designs: EXPERIMENTS: The strongest studies are experiments in which researchers can directly test a hypothesis while considering alternative explanations. In medicine, the best ones randomly assign a group of people to get either the treatment being tested or a fake version of it or a current standard of care. Neither the participants nor their doctors know who got what until the study ends (which is why they are called “double blind”). Sometimes experiments, especially early-stage ones, lack a comparison group, and that limits what can be known from the results. OBSERVATIONAL STUDIES: Observational studies examine a group of people or compare groups based on such factors as how much they weigh or what medicines they take. A common version is a study that looks for links between lifestyle habits or exposures to chemicals and diseases or conditions. Some things can be learned only from observational studies. For example, it would be unethical to assign one group to a medical test involving radiation every year and watch for 20 years to see how many develop cancer, and compare the results to a group that didn’t get the annual test. Drawing conclusions from observational studies is hard because many other things can affect results besides the factor being examined. This is called confounding. It is a particular problem with food, nutrition and diet studies because it is almost impossible to account for all the other things a person does over long periods.   But sometimes, especially when multiple observational studies reach the same conclusion, the evidence is strong enough to establish a cause-and-effect relationship. This is how scientists originally showed that smoking causes lung cancer. Prospective (forward-looking) observational studies, in which the study population is carefully tracked over time, are more reliable than retrospective studies, in which researchers must take a “best guess” approach by relying on questionnaires and looking back at records. META-ANALYSES: Another type of study is a meta-analysis, when researchers compile results of many related studies that individually are not big or strong enough to establish a point but that might suffice collectively. Reporting on these requires great care; much depends on which studies researchers include or leave out. Big numbers give statistical power to observe an effect, but combining studies also magnifies the flaws in each one’s methods. MODELS: In a modeling study, scientists use computer simulations to play out thousands of scenarios to see what could happen when changes are made to complex systems, like ecosystems, climate or cosmic events.  \nThe mathematics of the model should be checked with outside experts, along with the assumptions that go into the calculations. Researchers should show that they have rigorously tested the model by running it over and over — and, if possible, by applying it retroactively and seeing if the results match real-world observations from the past (such as air temperature or sea level, for climate models). RESEARCH STAGES: Drug studies usually are conducted in three phases in humans. In Phase 1, small numbers of people are given an experimental treatment to see if it’s safe. In Phase 2, more are treated to further test safety and determine appropriate dosages. Phase 3 studies are large tests of safety and effectiveness. It’s often best to wait to report until then because many things that look good early on fail at this stage. They’re also what regulators usually rely on for approval decisions.  Note: While it’s important for the reporter to understand this, there’s usually no need to bog down news stories with these terms. Instead of phase 1 , for example, call it early research . JUDGING STUDIES Here are some things to consider when evaluating a study: Is it in people or animals? Results in animals frequently don’t extend to humans.\nHow large is it? Bigger is almost always better, but it depends on the type of study. An experiment that tests drug X in 1,000 people and includes a comparison group is much more definitive than a 5,000-person observational study that notes just who took drug X and how they fared. In rare situations, studies of these size are impossible, and small studies are just as valid statistically. Is there something else that might explain or influence the results, such as age, other medical conditions, genetic differences or where people live? If so, did researchers adjust results to consider these in a way outside experts think is valid? Is it consistent with prior studies? Studies with results that contradict earlier, well-regarded research should be treated with more skepticism. That doesn’t mean you should ignore studies with outlier results, but you should vet them even more thoroughly than usual. Does the effect increase with the dose? In an environmental study, for instance, does the occurrence or severity of a health problem increase as the amount of toxic exposure increases? There may be a special reason if it doesn’t, but it may be a red flag. Is there a plausible biological explanation? A study result has more credibility if researchers can point to how it occurred. For example, a study finding that left-handed people are more likely to suffer from athlete’s foot should be regarded with great skepticism if researchers cannot suggest a credible explanation. On the other hand, a researcher who found that adding fluoride to a city’s water supply reduced tooth decay can credibly point to experiments showing that fluoride bonds with the outer layer of tooth enamel and strengthens it. Does it add to knowledge, or is it a “marketing study” designed to encourage doctors to use a company’s drug in the guise of a clinical trial? Similarly, be aware of awareness campaigns that may push readers to be tested for conditions they shouldn’t be, to create more “worried well,” and sell more drugs or boost donations to advocacy groups. NUMBERS Numbers can help you tell health, science and environment stories — and help you tell if there is a story to be told. First, we want to know whether the results of a study are statistically significant, which means that the risk they are just a fluke is acceptably low. Then we need to carefully show readers just how much difference in outcome the study found. Patients “did better” tells us little; “60 out of 100 patients who took the drug survived, compared with just 30 of 100 who did not” is much more informative. Here are some statistics you will encounter in studies. You will probably never tell your audience about p-values or confidence intervals, but they help you evaluate whether a study result is worth reporting. You probably will include risks and percentages because they can give your audience important context — as long as you handle them properly. RELATIVE RISK: Relative risk is the risk of something happening to one group compared with the risk of it happening to another. This is often expressed in a fraction or ratio in scientific studies. If there is no difference, the ratio is 1. For example, if a study finds that the relative risk of a group of smokers getting a disease is 1.5 compared with a group of nonsmokers, it means the smokers are 1.5 times as likely — or 50% more likely — to develop the disease. But it doesn’t say how likely it is that either group gets the disease. For that, you need absolute risk. ABSOLUTE RISK: Absolute risk is the risk of something happening at all. For example, the nonsmoking group in the above example may have had a 4 in 100 chance of getting the disease, while the smokers had a 6 in 100 chance of getting a disease. Another example: A drug that extends life by 50% (a relative risk) sounds impressive, but that might mean living six months on average on a treatment versus four months without. Readers deserve both views of the results. P-VALUE: A p-value (or probability value) is a measure that scientists use to gauge whether a result reflects a real, reliable difference or is just a fluke. Generally, a p-value of less than 0.05 suggests the result is reliable. So if a study reports that a drug lowered cholesterol and the result has a p-value of 0.04, it has met the test. This number is nearly always included in medical studies and in some science studies if relevant. Keep in mind, however, that such statistics can be gamed, in what is known as “p-hacking,” or cherry-picking experimental conditions until there is a statistically significant result. Ask researchers whether they tested more variables than they report. CONFIDENCE INTERVAL: In addition to a single result (often expressed as a relative risk), many medical, environmental and science studies include a confidence interval that encompasses the range of likely results. If a confidence interval ranges from below 1 to over 1, it means the result is not statistically significant. For example, if a drug lowered the risk of a heart attack but the confidence interval was 0.85 to 1.25, it fails the test; there is a meaningful chance that the drug did not actually lower the risk of heart attack. Another warning sign is if the upper and lower bound of a confidence interval are far apart (1.2 to 15.3, for example). In this sense, you can think of confidence intervals like margins of error in an opinion poll: the tighter the range, the better. SIGNIFICANT: Significant when referring to statistics means the results have passed statistical tests. But that does not mean the results are automatically noteworthy — or significant — for readers. Even though a study finds a statistically significant benefit from a treatment, that doesn’t necessarily mean it makes people feel noticeably better or is worth using. Study results that are not statistically significant should be treated with great skepticism, though there may occasionally be circumstances where a result is newsworthy even if it falls short of statistical significance. PERCENTAGES: There is a big difference between percent and percentage points, so be careful when using these terms to report results (see percent, percentage, percentage points ). If a drug changes the number of people in a group who have high blood pressure from 80% to 40%, that’s a 50% decline but a difference of 40 percentage points. REPORTING HEALTH AND SCIENCE Among the most critical parts of reporting a story that involves health, science or the environment is getting comments from outside experts who know the subject well. When reporting a study, you should find experts who had no role in the work. Ideally, consult more than one about the methods, the results and the conclusions being made by the study’s authors. This helps reveal whether the study is worth reporting and if so, why, even though the study has already been reviewed by peers. To find independent experts, check a study’s footnotes and references for who has previously researched the topic. PubMed and Google Scholar can also point to experts and previous studies for context. Ask them: Do you believe the conclusions? Does the evidence strongly support them? What are the problems with the study or conclusions? What other factors could be at play? Is this a big deal and why? How does this fit with what we knew before? Don’t rely solely on a news release about a study; always read the actual study. Sometimes news releases hype or exaggerate claims and conclusions beyond what a study really showed. Other important reporting tips and considerations include: FINANCIAL DISCLOSURES: Find out who paid for the research, and report it when it is relevant, which is almost always the case with studies of treatments. Much if not most medical research is paid for by private companies, or advocacy or special interest groups; governments increasingly fund a smaller share. This doesn’t mean the work is bad or wrong, but stories need to report what role the sponsor played (supplied the drug? compiled the results?). Include what ties, if any, the researchers had to the sponsor or its competitors, and whether the researchers might profit through patents or royalties. Sometimes sponsorship is a reason not to write, such as a health claim for a food based on an industry-funded study. CAVEATS: Science is rarely definitive. There often are other potential explanations for a phenomenon or competing interpretations of what a fossil tells us about the past. As long as those alternatives also have a sound scientific underpinning, they should be noted. SIDE EFFECTS: There always are risks or side effects to treatments. If a news release or a meeting abstract doesn’t mention that, it’s a red flag — and you need to find out. Any story reporting a treatment’s benefits also should include its risks and any serious side effects. COSTS: Always try to include the cost of a treatment. If it’s experimental and the cost hasn’t been set, often you can discuss context, such as the cost of other similar treatments. Also try to find out if insurers are likely to cover it, or note that it is still unclear whether they will and that insurance policies and out-of-pocket costs vary. Often, that’s what patients need to know. TIME TO MARKET: Remember that it can take many years for a drug to move from testing to government approval and commercial use. Many drugs never make the transition because of concerns about profitability or effectiveness. Readers often assume that they will be able to use an experimental drug immediately after it has been tested. Avoid giving them false hope. Instead, explain the steps that lie ahead and how long they are likely to take. PITFALLS FALSE BALANCE: Do not give a platform to unfounded claims or unqualified sources in the guise of balancing a story by including all views. This perpetuates denialism. For example, coverage of a study describing effects of climate change should not seek “other side” comment that humans have no influence on the climate; in reporting about lung cancer deaths, do not pursue comment that smoking does not cause cancer. On the other hand: Recognize when statements are false but also newsworthy and necessary to report. Examples include a key policymaker rejecting mainstream climate science, or parents lobbying Congress with the argument that vaccines cause autism. Such statements or actions need to be reported — but such stories must prominently include fact-checking material making clear that science shows the statements are wrong. PATIENTS AND FAMILIES: When writing about the medical conditions of patients or public figures, it’s important to verify information supplied by the patient, friends or family with medical records or their doctor. Without confirmation, attribute the information to its source. This is not to say that patients are not worth talking to; quite the opposite. Patients’ experiences and their struggle to understand and navigate their condition and how it is being treated is often interesting and newsworthy. But quote patients on their lives and their feelings; quote scientists on science. Use care when featuring patients in anecdotes to make sure they are truly representative or typical of what you’re writing about. Be wary of patients suggested by drug or device makers to speak with journalists because they may have been compensated or coached. NONEXPERTS: Don’t report medical advice from celebrities or sports figures. They’re often paid by companies or advocacy groups to pitch products or a point of view, such as the need for certain cancer screenings or a diet or “wellness” product, and they are not scientific or medical experts. TOXIC CHEMICALS, RADIATION, CARCINOGENS: Living down the street from a dump doesn’t necessarily raise someone’s risk for a disease. Working with a known cancer-causing substance for decades might. Reporting on these topics requires consulting toxicologists, public health researchers and other specialists. As with general reporting, avoid reporting claims that are based on advocacy or made by lawyers or people who claim to be affected rather than science. When news requires coverage, for example when a major lawsuit is filed, be sure to note if the claims have not yet been proven. Treat all claims made by sources — whether they are made by polluters or by those who claim to be affected — with the same level of scrutiny. Making sure to include absolute risk (discussed above) when reporting on these subjects is critical to provide readers an accurate understanding of danger. CANCER CLUSTERS: Most suspected clusters, after investigation, turn out to be either baseless or unverifiable. That’s especially true if they involve many types of cancer, which have many different causes. Other factors such as a family history of the disease, genes that predispose people to it and habits such as smoking all affect cancer risk. It requires public health expertise and training to sort out these risks, so always seek out qualified independent experts when reporting on alleged clusters. CURES: Avoid calling a disease cured, especially cancer. An infection or temporary condition can be cured, but doctors can’t be sure that a cancer won’t recur, so they say “remission” for that reason. WRITING TIPS We are translators between people who speak the language of science and ordinary readers who don’t. If you don’t understand a term or know for certain that you can replace a technical term with a more reader-friendly one, ask an expert for help. You can write high blood pressure instead of hypertension , for example, but you cannot refer to a cardiac arrest as a heart attack , because they are two different things. As in all writing, avoid jargon and cliches — even in direct quotations. Some common science and medical jargon that can be said more simply include: clinician (use doctor instead), efficacy (just say how well it works or not), literature (other studies), pathogen ( germs ), proportion ( share ), prevalence (say how common something is), trials or clinical trials ( studies, research ), underlying condition ( other conditions, other medical conditions ). Some common cliches in science writing include: cutting edge, holy grail, game changing, low-hanging fruit, outside of the box, paradigm shift, perfect storm, sci-fi, sea change, silver bullet, smoking gun, tip of the iceberg, wake-up call .

{"source_url": "https://www.apstylebook.com/ap_stylebook/race-related-coverage", "entry_header": "race-related coverage", "text_content": "Reporting and writing about issues involving race calls for thoughtful consideration, precise language, and discussions with others of diverse backgrounds whenever possible about how to frame coverage or what language is most appropriate, accurate and fair. Avoid broad generalizations and labels; race and ethnicity are one part of a person’s identity. Identifying people by race and reporting on actions that have to do with race often go beyond simple style questions, challenging journalists to think broadly about racial issues before having to make decisions on specific situations and stories. In all coverage — not just race-related coverage — strive to accurately represent the world, or a particular community, and its diversity through the people you quote and depict in all formats. Omissions and lack of inclusion can render people invisible. Be aware that some words and phrases that seem innocuous to one group can carry negative connotations, even be seen as slurs, to another. As with all news coverage, be sensitive to your varied audiences and their different perceptions of language and the larger world. For instance, many people see thug as code for a racial slur; Black boy has a loaded history and should be avoided in referring to Black males of any age; unarmed Black man could be seen as assuming the default is for Black men to be armed. Do not write in a way that assumes white is default. Not: The officer is accused of choking Owens, who is Black . Instead: The white officer is accused of choking Owens, who is Black . Some guidelines: race Consider carefully when deciding whether to identify people by race. Often, it is an irrelevant factor and drawing unnecessary attention to someone’s race or ethnicity can be interpreted as bigotry. There are, however, occasions when race is pertinent: In stories that involve significant, groundbreaking or historic events, such as being elected U.S. president, being named to the U.S. Supreme Court or other notable occurrences. Barack Obama was the first Black U.S. president. Sonia Sotomayor is the first Hispanic justice of the U.S. Supreme Court. Jeremy Lin was the first American-born NBA player of Chinese or Taiwanese descent . In cases where suspects or missing people are being sought, and the descriptions provided are detailed and not solely racial. Any racial reference should be removed when the individual is apprehended or found. When reporting a demonstration, disturbance or other conflict involving race (including verbal conflicts), or issues like civil rights. In other situations when race is an issue, use news judgment. Include racial or ethnic details only when they are clearly relevant and that relevance is explicit in the story. Do not use a derogatory term except in rare circumstances — when it is crucial to the story or the understanding of a news event. Flag the contents in an editor’s note. See the Inclusive Storytelling chapter; the Religion chapter; and obscenities, profanities, vulgarities . racist, racism Racism is a set of attitudes, beliefs, and actions asserting racial differences in character, intelligence, etc., and asserting the superiority of one race over another, or racial discrimination or feelings of hatred or bigotry toward people of another race. The terms systemic racism, structural racism and institutional racism refer to social, political and institutional systems and cultures that contribute to racial inequality in areas such as employment, health care, housing, the criminal justice system and education. Avoid shortening this use to simply racism , to avoid confusion with the other definition. Some use the term racist to refer to anyone who benefits from systemic racism and doesn’t actively work to dismantle it. Avoid this use unless essential in a direct quotation; if used, explain it. Deciding whether a specific statement, action, policy, etc., should be termed racist , or characterized in a different way, often is not clear-cut. Such decisions should include discussion with colleagues and/or others from diverse backgrounds and perspectives. At the AP, that conversation should also include senior managers. Begin by assessing the facts: Does the statement, action, policy, etc., meet the definition of racism ? That assessment need not involve examining the motivation of the person who spoke or acted, which is a separate issue that may not be related to how the statement or action itself can be characterized. In general, avoid using racist or any other label as a noun for a person; it’s far harder to match the complexity of a person to a definition or label than it is a statement or action. Instead, be specific in describing the person’s words or actions. Again, discuss with senior managers, colleagues and others from diverse backgrounds when the description may be appropriate for a person. Cases in which the term racist might be used include identifying as racist support for avowed racist organizations, statements calling another race or ethnic group inferior, or employing negative stereotypes for different racial or ethnic groups. The video shows the candidate wearing blackface and making racist statements including, “You’re not white so you can’t be right.” If racist is not the appropriate term, give careful thought to how best to describe the situation. Depending on the specifics of what was said or done, alternatives may include xenophobic, bigoted, biased, nativist, racially divisive , or in some cases, simply racial . Avoid racially charged, racially motivated or racially tinged , euphemisms which convey little meaning. Always provide specifics to describe the words or actions in question; using a broad and descriptive term such as racist requires supporting details and context. In doing so, avoid repeating derogatory terms except in the rare circumstances when it is crucial to the story or the understanding of a news event. Provide context and historical perspective when appropriate to help convey the impact or implications of the words or actions. For example, a story about a candidate wearing blackface should include context about performers in the 1800s who darkened their faces to create bigoted caricatures of Black people. A story about comments that certain members of Congress should “go back” to their “broken and crime-infested” countries should include the context that “go back to where you came from” is a racist insult aimed for decades at immigrants and African Americans in the United States. See racially charged, racially motivated, racially tinged , and other entries in race-related coverage . racially charged, racially motivated, racially tinged Avoid using these vague phrases to describe situations in which race is or is alleged or perceived to be a central issue, but that do not meet the definition of racist or racism . As alternatives, terms including xenophobic, bigoted, biased, nativist or racially divisive may be clearer, depending on the context. In some cases, the term racial is appropriate: racial arguments, racial tensions, racial injustice . Always give specifics about what was done, said or alleged. Do not use euphemisms for racist or racism when the latter terms are truly applicable. Mississippi has a history of racist lynchings , not a history of racially motivated lynchings . He is charged in the racist massacre of nine people at a Black church , not the racially motivated massacre of nine people at a Black church . See racist, racism , and other entries in race-related coverage . critical race theory An academic framework dating to the 1970s that centers on the idea that racism is systemic in the nation’s institutions and that those institutions maintain the dominance of white people. The theory is a way of analyzing American history through the lens of racism. It has become a catch-all political buzzword for any teaching in schools about race and American history, and a rallying cry for some conservatives who take issue with how schools have addressed diversity and inclusion. The theory itself is not a fixture of K-12 education. Those opposed to critical race theory say it divides society by defining people as oppressors and oppressed based on their race. They call it an attempt to rewrite American history and make white people believe they are inherently racist. Explain the term when used. Don’t use CRT on later references. BIPOC, BAME, POC See people of color . biracial, multiracial Acceptable, when clearly relevant, to describe people with more than one racial heritage. Usually more useful when describing large, diverse groups of people than individuals. Avoid mixed-race , which can carry negative connotations, unless a story subject prefers the term. Be specific if possible, and then use biracial for people of two heritages or multiracial for those of two or more on subsequent references if needed. Examples: She has an African American father and a white mother instead of She is biracial. But: The study of biracial people showed a split in support along gender lines. Multiracial can encompass people of any combination of races. brown (adj.) Avoid this broad and imprecise term in racial, ethnic or cultural references unless as part of a direct quotation. Interpretations of what the term includes vary widely. Be specific. Caucasian Avoid as a synonym for white , unless in a quotation. dual heritage No hyphen for terms such as African American, Asian American and Filipino American , used when relevant to refer to an American person’s heritage. The terms are less common when used to describe non-Americans, but may be used when relevant: Turkish German for a German of Turkish descent. For terms denoting dual citizenship, use the hyphen: a dual U.S.-Australian citizen . locs A rope-like hairstyle that is a common protective hairstyle among Black people. Specify dreadlocks, dreads when referring to people with the hairstyle who are of Jamaican descent or Rastafarian belief. Locks refers to hair in general. minority, racial minority The term is acceptable as an adjective in broad references to multiple races other than white in the United States: We will hire more members of minority groups. Be sure the term is accurate in each circumstance, since what constitutes a racial minority varies by location. Be specific whenever possible by referring to, for instance, Black Americans, Chinese Americans or members of the Seminole Tribe of Florida . Examples: The poll found that Black and Latino Americans are bearing the brunt of the pandemic’s financial impact , not minorities are bearing the brunt of the pandemic’s financial impact . Most of the magazine’s readers are Black women , not most of the magazine’s readers are minority women . Do not use minority as a noun in the singular. Limit use of the plural minorities unless needed for reasons of space or sentence construction. Phrasing such as minority students or minority groups is preferable. people of color The term is acceptable when necessary in broad references to multiple races other than white: We will hire more people of color. Nine playwrights of color collaborated on the script. Be aware, however, that many people of various races object to the term for various reasons, including that it lumps together into one monolithic group anyone who isn’t white. Be specific whenever possible by referring to, for instance, Black Americans, Chinese Americans or members of the Seminole Tribe of Florida . Examples: The poll found that Black and Latino Americans are bearing the brunt of the pandemic’s financial impact , not people of color are bearing the brunt of the pandemic’s financial impact . Most of the magazine’s readers are Black women , not most of the magazine’s readers are women of color . In some cases, other wording may be appropriate. Examples: people from various racial and ethnic backgrounds; diverse groups; various heritages; different cultures . Do not use person of color for an individual. Do not use the term Black, Indigenous and people of color , which some see as more inclusive by distinguishing the experiences of Black and Indigenous people but others see as less inclusive by diminishing the experiences of everyone else. Similarly, do not use the term Black, Asian and minority ethnic . Do not use the shorthand POC , BIPOC or BAME unless necessary in a direct quotation; when used, explain it. reverse discrimination A term sometimes used to describe bias or perceived bias against majority groups. Limit its use to quotes; generally just discrimination will suffice to describe such allegations or practices. transracial The term should not be used to describe people who have adopted a different racial identity. — Aborigine An outdated term referring to Aboriginal people in Australia. It is considered offensive by some and should be avoided. — African American No hyphen for this and other dual-heritage terms. Acceptable for an American Black person of African descent. The terms are not necessarily interchangeable. Americans of Caribbean heritage, for example, generally refer to themselves as Caribbean American . Follow a person’s preference. Black (adj.) Use the capitalized term as an adjective in a racial, ethnic or cultural sense: Black people, Black culture, Black literature, Black studies, Black colleges . African American is also acceptable for those in the U.S. The terms are not necessarily interchangeable. Americans of Caribbean heritage, for example, generally refer to themselves as Caribbean American . Follow a person’s preference if known, and be specific when possible and relevant. Minneapolis has a large Somali American population because of refugee resettlement. The author is Senegalese American. Use of the capitalized Black recognizes that language has evolved, along with the common understanding that especially in the United States, the term reflects a shared identity and culture rather than a skin color alone. Also use Black in racial, ethnic and cultural differences outside the U.S. to avoid equating a person with a skin color. Use Negro or colored only in names of organizations or in rare quotations when essential. See obscenities, profanities, vulgarities . Black(s), white(s) (n.) Do not use either term as a singular or plural noun. Instead, use phrasing such as Black people, white people, Black teachers, white students . Black and white are acceptable as adjectives when relevant. boy, girl Generally acceptable to describe males or females younger than 18. While it is always inaccurate to call people under 18 men or women and people 18 and older boys or girls , be aware of nuances and unintentional implications. Referring to Black males of any age and in any context as boys , for instance, can be perceived as demeaning and call to mind historical language used by some to address Black men. Be specific about ages if possible, or refer to Black youths, child, teen or similar. Black Lives Matter A global movement launched in 2013 after the acquittal in the killing of Trayvon Martin with a goal to eradicate systemic racism and white supremacy and to oppose violence committed against Black people. Either Black Lives Matter as a noun or the Black Lives Matter movement is acceptable. BLM is acceptable on second reference. Although there are many groups that use Black Lives Matter or BLM in their names, only 16 are considered affiliates of the Black Lives Matter Global Network . The Black Lives Matter Global Network Foundation , which provides organizational infrastructure and funding to the affiliate chapters, was founded in 2014 after what is known as the Ferguson uprising over the August 2014 police shooting death of Michael Brown in Ferguson, Missouri. The BLM network is acceptable on second reference. Some respond to the Black Lives Matter movement by saying “all lives matter” or “blue lives matter,” the latter in reference to police officers. Neither is a formal movement, so lowercase and enclose in quotes. slaves, enslaved people The term slaves denotes an inherent identity of a person or people treated as chattel or property. The term enslaved people underlines that the slave status has been imposed on individuals. Many prefer the term enslaved person/people to separate people’s identity from their circumstances. Others prefer the term slave as a way to make a point of the circumstances. Either term is acceptable. Try to determine a person’s preference. Juneteenth June 19, the traditional commemoration date of the emancipation of enslaved people in the United States. On June 17, 2021, President Joe Biden signed legislation making it a U.S. federal holiday. The holiday also has been called Juneteenth Independence Day or Freedom Day . President Abraham Lincoln issued the initial version of the Emancipation Proclamation, declaring all slaves free in Confederate territory, on Sept. 22, 1862, but it could not be enforced in many places until after the Confederacy surrendered in the Civil War. June 19, 1865, is the date of an order by recently arrived U.S. Army Maj. Gen. Gordon Granger in Galveston, Texas, to enforce the Emancipation Proclamation. historically Black colleges and universities U.S. colleges and universities established before 1964 with the mission of educating Black Americans. The schools were founded at a time when Black students were barred from many institutions that served white people. Before these accredited, degree-granting institutions were created, no structured higher education system for Black students existed. There are approximately 100 such schools now, and they admit students of any race. HBCUs is acceptable on second reference and in headlines. HBCU is acceptable as a modifier on second reference: HBCU students . Refer to an individual school as a historically Black college or a historically Black university . Don’t use HBCU for one college or university. — Arab American No hyphen for this and other dual-heritage terms. Acceptable for an American of Arab descent. When possible, refer to a person’s country of origin or follow the person’s preference. For example: Lebanese American or Egyptian American . Although most Arabs worldwide are Muslim, many Arab Americans are not. Don’t assume that everyone from a predominantly Arab country identifies as Arab; ask them. Arab Americans are classified as white by the U.S. government on federal forms and in the census. Many Arab Americans reject that classification, saying it does not reflect their life experiences or the way they are regarded in American society. Some argue it renders their communities invisible. As a result, many Arab Americans simply check “other” on forms. Arab American organizations say that contributes to what they say is a chronic undercounting of their numbers in America. — Asian Used to describe people from Asia. Avoid using Asian as shorthand for Asian American when possible. Asian American No hyphen for this and other dual-heritage terms. Acceptable for an American of Asian descent. When possible, refer to a person’s country of origin or follow the person’s preference. For example: Filipino American or Indian American . Do not describe Pacific Islanders as Asian Americans, Asians or of Asian descent . Avoid using Asian as shorthand for Asian American when possible. AAPI Asian Americans and Pacific Islanders . The acronym is widely used by people within these communities but is not as well known outside of them. Spell out the full term; use AAPI only in direct quotations and explain the term. anti-Asian sentiment Avoid this euphemism, which conveys little meaning. Alternatives may include anti-Asian bias, anti-Asian harassment, anti-Asian comments, anti-Asian racism or anti-Asian violence , depending on the situation. Be specific and give details about what happened or what someone says happened. Orient, Oriental Do not use when referring to East Asian nations and their peoples. Asian is the acceptable term for an inhabitant of those regions. Pacific Islander Used to describe the Indigenous people of the Pacific Islands, including but not limited to Hawaii, Guam and Samoa. Should be used for people who are ethnically Pacific Islander, not for those who happen to live in Pacific Islands. Be specific about which communities you are referring to whenever possible. Do not use Asian Pacific Islander unless referring to Pacific Islanders of Asian descent. Do not describe Pacific Islanders as Asian Americans, Asians or of Asian descent . Stop AAPI Hate A movement that was launched in March 2020 in response to a rise in anti-Asian bias and racism stemming from the coronavirus pandemic that originated in China. The Asian Pacific Planning and Policy Council, Chinese for Affirmative Action and the Asian American Studies Department of San Francisco State University created a reporting center under the name Stop AAPI Hate to track and respond to cases of hate, violence, harassment and discrimination against Asian Americans and Pacific Islanders in the United States. — Latino, Latina, Latinx Latino is often the preferred noun or adjective for a person from, or whose ancestors were from, a Spanish-speaking land or culture or from Latin America. Latina is the feminine form. Some prefer the gender-neutral term Latinx , which should be confined to quotations, names of organizations or descriptions of individuals who request it and should be accompanied by a short explanation. Hernandez prefers the gender-neutral term Latinx. For groups of females, use the plural Latinas; for groups of males or of mixed gender, use the plural Latinos . Hispanics is also generally acceptable for those in the U.S. Use a more specific identification when possible, such as Cuban, Puerto Rican, Brazilian or Mexican American . Hispanic A person from — or whose ancestors were from — a Spanish-speaking land or culture. Latino, Latina or Latinx are sometimes preferred. Follow the person’s preference. Use a more specific identification when possible, such as Cuban, Puerto Rican or Mexican American . Chicano A term that Mexican Americans in the U.S. Southwest sometimes use to describe their heritage. Use only if it is a person’s preference. — Native Americans, Indigenous people/peoples Generally use the term Native Americans in broad references when referring to two or more people of different tribal affiliations within the contiguous U.S. geographic boundaries. (See below for details on Alaska Natives and Native Hawaiians .) Do not use the term Native American for an individual; see below for detail on more specificity when referring to one person or to citizens of the same tribe. The term Natives is acceptable on second reference. The term American Indians is generally considered outdated. However, some tribal citizens may use the term in reference to themselves, other tribal citizens or organizations. And it may appear in some legal contexts and organization names. It is acceptable in those contexts. The term Indigenous people(s) is a broad umbrella term, describing the original inhabitants of a place globally. The term does not capture the political relationship or political status of Native American tribes or people, so use it only when the broad description is accurate. Be specific about a person’s citizenship and/or affiliation, as noted below. The term may be appropriate in some contexts, such as when generalizing across an array of geographies: Indigenous people in the United States and Canada; Indigenous people in the United States (encompassing Native Hawaiians and Alaska Natives); Missing and Murdered Indigenous People . Do not use phrasing such as a Native American or Native Americans (or an Indigenous person ) for individuals or for citizens of a single tribe. Instead, specify the proper name of the tribe and the person’s connection to the tribe. If that information is not immediately available, try to obtain it. Some tribes and tribal nations use member ; others use citizen . Try to determine the correct term in each case. If that can’t be determined, use citizen . It is also important to determine if an individual is enrolled (a citizen ) of the tribe, or if they are a descendant (not enrolled but a biological descendant) of an enrolled citizen. She is an enrolled member of the Nisqually Indian Tribe. He is a citizen of the Cherokee Nation and a descendant of the Comanche Nation. Some Native Americans describe themselves as descendants of multiple tribes. That lineage should be noted after the person’s citizenship or enrollment affiliation. For tribal affiliations, use the person’s preference and clarify with the official name of the tribe if necessary. For example, some members of the Navajo Nation refer to themselves as Diné , the Navajo word for the people. Do not use possessive language such as Canada’s Indigenous people, Oklahoma’s Native American tribes or South Dakota’s Pine Ridge Reservation . Instead: Indigenous people in Canada; Native American tribes in Oklahoma; the Pine Ridge Reservation in South Dakota . The possessive form may be used for Native Hawaiians, however. Use the term Hawaiian or Hawaiians only for members of the ethnic group indigenous to the Hawaiian Islands. They also may be called Native Hawaiians, Indigenous people in Hawaii or Hawaii’s Indigenous people . Hawaii is a creation of Hawaiians — the island chain was united by King Kamehameha and then was ruled by Hawaiians until the U.S.-backed overthrow of the monarchy in 1893. Many Hawaiians view Hawaii as a place that is rightfully theirs and a place to which they belong. Many Hawaiians believe the United States and the state of Hawaii are illegal occupiers of these lands and are fighting to return Hawaiian sovereignty to Hawaii. In Alaska, the Indigenous groups are collectively known as Alaska Natives . Be specific when referring to individual tribes and Alaska Native villages and to individual people, as described above. In Canada, the umbrella term Indigenous people(s) is used by the federal government to describe First Nations, Inuit and Métis . Be specific when referring to individual communities and people, as described above. Indian is used to describe the peoples and cultures of the South Asian nation of India. Do not use the term as a shorthand for Native Americans , either a single person or a group. However, Indian is acceptable when part of a proper name, such as Indian Country, the Gila River Indian Community in Arizona or the Metlakatla Indian Community in Alaska . — Native, Natives The term Natives is acceptable on second reference for Native Americans . The term Native is acceptable as an adjective — Native music, Native art — but if the story is not generally about Native Americans , use Native American music, Native American art , etc. tribe Refers to a sovereign political entity, communities sharing a common ancestry, culture or language, and a social group of linked families who may be part of an ethnic group. Capitalize the word tribe when part of a formal name of sovereign political entities, or communities sharing a common ancestry, culture or language. Identify tribes by the political identity specified by the tribe, nation or community: the Apache Tribe of Oklahoma, the Cherokee Nation . The term ethnic group is preferred when referring to ethnicity or ethnic violence. tribal affiliation The 574 federally recognized tribes as of early 2024 determine how to count their own citizens or members. The primary means are calculating the percentage of one’s ancestry related to a specific tribe, known as blood quantum ; or tracing ancestry to a list of names kept by a tribe. Verify tribal enrollment with the source and, if needed, the tribe itself. Ensure proper context is used when writing about whether someone is enrolled. Alaska Native corporations Created under the 1971 Alaska Native Settlement Claims Act, which transferred Native land to for-profit corporations. Alaska Natives from 229 federally recognized tribes are shareholders in the corporations that run oil, gas, mining and other enterprises, and provide services to Alaska Natives. The Metlakatla Indian Community opted out of the settlement act and has the only reservation in Alaska. The corporations are not synonymous with tribal governments , which continue to exist independently. Indian Country Narrowly, a legal reference to all lands, under the jurisdiction of and often held in trust by the U.S. government, lying within the geographic boundaries of Indian reservations. It is more commonly used in the vernacular to describe the lands, waters, governments, organizations and people that constitute the interconnected Indigenous peoples within the United States. Indigenous (adj.) Capitalize this term used to refer to original inhabitants of a place. Indigenous peoples Groupings of people who are the original inhabitants of their countries. Use peoples when referring to multiple Indigenous groups. Use people when referring to multiple individuals from different Indigenous groups. Indigenous Peoples Day A holiday celebrating the original inhabitants of North America, observed instead of Columbus Day in some U.S. localities. Usually held on the second Monday of October, coinciding with the federal Columbus Day holiday. See Columbus Day . language Do not use the word squaw in any sense, including quotes, to refer to individual Native Americans. The word is acceptable if necessary as a first reference in referring to a place, but limit its use. Do not use terms such as Indian summer and Indian giver . Avoid words such as warpath and powwow , or phrases such as circle the wagons and hold down the fort , which can be disparaging and offensive. They are appropriate if used in the proper context and not meant casually or disparagingly. Missing and Murdered Indigenous People A grassroots movement to draw attention to disproportionate violence against Indigenous people, particularly women and children, and the lack of data in law enforcement agencies. The movement is symbolized by a red hand over the mouth that reflects solidarity with victims whose voices have been silenced. On second reference use the movement , not MMIP . The term murder is acceptable in this group’s name. Otherwise, follow general Stylebook guidance: Do not say that a victim was murdered until someone has been convicted in court. Instead, say that a person was killed . tipi (not teepee) A traditional dwelling among Native Americans in the northern Great Plains region. tribal colleges and universities The roughly three dozen schools on or near Native American reservations that seek to incorporate culture and tradition into education. The schools, primarily in the Southwest and Midwest, are a mix of two-year and four-year institutions. The Navajo Nation, which extends into Arizona, New Mexico and Utah, opened the first tribal college in the United States in 1968. The schools are represented by the American Indian Higher Education Consortium."}
{"source_url": "https://www.apstylebook.com/ap_stylebook/obesity-obese-overweight", "entry_header": "obesity, obese, overweight", "text_content": "People with obesity, people of higher weights and people who prefer the term fat use diverse terms — including those and others — in reference to themselves. Many say the words obesity and obese are offensive or stigmatizing. On the other hand, the terms obesity and obese define a disease, according to global and national public health agencies, and are used by medical and health care professionals. Use care and precision, considering the impact of specific words and the terms used by the people you are writing about. When possible, ask people how they want to be described. See below for details. The World Health Organization, the American Medical Association and other health groups say obesity is a chronic disease resulting from factors that can include genetics and a variety of social and environmental factors. About 42% of U.S. adults have obesity, according to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. The WHO says that 650 million people globally had obesity as of 2016, its most recent count, a number that has tripled since 1975. The phrasing people with obesity or a person with obesity is acceptable when a general term is needed and is relevant, unless a group or person prefers other terms. The term obesity is used most often in a health or medical context: Researchers hope the treatment helps people with obesity . Avoid the modifier obese when possible. Although obese is a variant of the term obesity , many medical professionals say the use as a modifier is more stigmatizing by putting a greater focus on the person rather than on the disease. That stigma can cause people not to seek treatment, they say. The term medically classified as obese is acceptable in medical and health care contexts. Do not use the term morbidly obese . Some people and groups identify as and prefer the term fat , seeking to eliminate the stigma around both the word and the people. Others say the word has long been seen as a slur and should be avoided. The terms fat and fatness are acceptable for people or groups that use it for themselves, but make clear that this is the preference of the person or group. A brief explanation may be helpful. Some people with obesity use terms such as plus-sized, people of higher weight, larger-bodied, people of size and others. Those terms are acceptable for people or groups that use it for themselves, and in later references in general stories about obesity. While some health agencies use the phrasing people with overweight , avoid that awkward term unless essential in a direct quotation. The term people who are overweight is acceptable. Avoid writing that implies ableism : the belief that abilities of people who aren’t of higher weight are superior. Don’t limit coverage of larger-bodied people to coverage of obesity, as that contributes to stereotypes and discrimination. Seek other angles including those in retail, arts and sports, and include the voices and images of people with obesity who are experts in a given area in stories about that topic. The terms overweight and obese are not interchangeable because they have specific medical definitions. A person with a body mass index of 25 to 29 is considered overweight. A person with a BMI of 30 or higher is considered to have obesity, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. A BMI of 18.5 to 24 is considered a healthy weight. Many experts acknowledge that BMI is a flawed metric because it does not directly measure body fat, but say it remains a useful and convenient guide. See body mass index ."}
{"source_url": "https://www.apstylebook.com/ap_stylebook/immigration-migration", "entry_header": "immigration, migration", "text_content": "Political rhetoric and high passion are a large part of discussions and debate about migration and immigration worldwide. Language that is both neutral and accurate is essential in news coverage. At the same time, be aware that definitions or perceptions of some terms can vary around the world. Globally, for example, there is no uniform legal definition of the term migrant . Be as specific as possible in describing an event, and provide both specific detail and broader context. Governments around the world limit access to border operations, making it harder to know the reality of what is going on. Describing current restrictions helps explain gaps in what we know and why. Some guidance on language: crisis Use caution and judgment in deciding whether to call a specific immigration or migration situation a crisis, a vague and subjective term. If quoting others who use the word crisis , ask for specifics about what is meant. There could be a humanitarian crisis if the numbers grow so large that officials cannot house the migrants safely or in sanitary conditions. Migrants may face humanitarian crises in their home countries. In theory, there could be a security or a border crisis if officials lose control of the border, allowing people to enter unencumbered in large numbers. But, in general, avoid hyperbole in calling anything a crisis or an emergency . other descriptions Avoid imagery conjuring war or natural disaster such as onslaught, tidal wave, flood, inundation, invasion, army, march, sneak and stealth . Instead, use numbers and facts. For example: Biden is contending with the largest number of migrant encounters at the border in 20 years. It is the largest number of unaccompanied children encountered at the border on record. Overcrowded detention facilities have sent U.S. authorities scrambling for space and prompted the administration to dispatch FEMA to the border. Using words like rise, increase, upturn, uptick, spike, surge, fall, decrease or downturn is legitimate to describe the change in numbers of people entering across the border as long as it is supported by facts. But try to be precise about what time period these terms refer to and, again, provide details and context. Other terms illegal immigration Entering or living in a country without authorization in violation of civil or criminal law. Except in direct quotations essential to the story, use illegal only to refer to an action, not a person: illegal immigration , but not illegal immigrant . Acceptable variations include living in or entering a country illegally or without legal permission . For people: immigrants lacking permanent legal status . The European Union and some U.N. agencies use the term irregular migration ; that term is acceptable in areas where it is commonly used. Do not use irregular migrants . When space is a consideration, such as in a headline, simply migrant(s) or immigrant(s) is acceptable as long as the context is clear in the first few paragraphs of the story. Do not use the terms alien, unauthorized immigrant, irregular migrant, an illegal, illegals or undocumented (except when quoting people or government documents that use these terms). Many immigrants have some sort of documents, but not the necessary ones. In the U.S., the Biden administration has replaced the word alien in government documents with noncitizen . Limit use of the term, which can be misleading: Noncitizen makes no distinction between those who have legal status and those who don’t. Many people are in the country with legal status, such as green-card holders, people on student visas, tourists and temporary workers. Do not use the term alien . Do not describe without attribution people as violating immigration laws. Specify wherever possible how someone entered the country illegally and from where. Crossed the border? Overstayed a visa? What nationality? Consider carefully when deciding whether a person’s immigration status is relevant to a story. Often such decisions should involve discussions with managers. Include immigration status only when it is relevant and that relevance is explicit in the story. immigration, immigrant, migration, migrant immigrants The term generally refers to people who move to a different country with the intention of settling there. This term, rather than migrants , is most commonly used for people established in the U.S., which usually is their final destination. It also is used when another specific country is the final destination. For example: British immigration statistics show how many people settled in the country last year . migrants The term generally refers to people who are on the move, sometimes for economic reasons, either within one country or across borders. The term is generally preferred over immigrant in Europe, Africa, the Mideast and Asia, where a person’s destination country may be undecided or in flux. The term migrant also may be used for those whose reason for leaving their home country is not clear, or to cover people who may also be refugees or asylum-seekers . But be specific whenever possible, or use other phrasing such as people struggling to enter Europe, Cubans seeking new lives in the United States, families seeking to join relatives in the U.S. If a given group of people is known to include both migrants and refugees , say so. People moving within the 50 U.S. states, or from a U.S. territory to one of the 50 states, should not be referred to as immigrants, because they are moving within a single country. migrant children/child migrants They may travel alone or with family members; make the distinction if possible. Migrant children traveling alone may also be described as unaccompanied migrant children . Use migrant in this context to reflect their status of moving from one place to another. refugees People compelled to leave their home or country to escape war, natural disaster, or persecution on the grounds of race, religion, nationality, political beliefs or some other grounds, which may include sexual orientation, gender identity, or gang or domestic violence. asylum-seekers People who have left their country of origin and have applied or intend to apply for asylum status. Asylum, under U.S. and international law, is permission granted to refugees to remain within the country to which they have fled. It is not intended for people leaving for economic reasons. Use specific terms such as political asylum or religious asylum only when the person’s reason for seeking asylum is known. In the United States, people fleeing their home countries who do not qualify for asylum may be eligible for “withholding of removal” or the U.N. Convention Against Torture, which offer similar protections. internally displaced person/people Avoid this jargon. Refer simply to people who are displaced within their own countries or otherwise describe their situation. Limited use of the terms displaced person and displaced people is acceptable on later references. Do not call them refugees if they are within their own country. “anchor babies” A pejorative term in the U.S. for children who are born to noncitizen parents wanting to take advantage of birthright citizenship . Avoid it unless part of an essential quote; enclose it in quote marks and explain it if used. birthright citizenship A country’s policy and practice of granting citizenship to anyone born within its borders. In the United States, the Constitution guarantees that any child born in and under jurisdiction of the United States is a U.S. citizen. The term is acceptable, but include an explanation. “birth tourism” A term sometimes used for traveling to another country specifically to give birth in that country. Avoid it unless part of a quote; instead, describe the action. For example: visiting the U.S. with intent to give birth to a U.S. citizen child . Enclose the term in quote marks if used. “catch and release” A term favored by advocates of immigration restriction for people who are taken into custody at the border for being in the United States illegally and released in the U.S., typically with notices to appear in immigration court. Do not use this misleading and dehumanizing term unless in direct quotations; enclose it in quote marks and explain the term when used. “chain migration” A term applied by those who favor strict immigration limits to what the U.S. government calls family-based immigration , a long-standing program granting preference to people with close relatives who already have legal residency or U.S. citizenship. Avoid the term, which is vague and may imply unfettered immigration, which is not allowed under U.S. law. If needed in a direct quotation, enclose the term in quote marks and explain it. deportation, expulsion The term deportation can be used generically for the forced removal of someone from a country for violating immigration laws or having been declared by authorities to have no legal right to remain. But be aware that the term may have specific legal meaning in some cases. In the United States, deportation is synonymous with the legal term removal and is predicated on a formal order to leave the country, which carries legal consequences in terms of bans on legally returning to the country and exposure to criminal charges if arrested for returning illegally. Expedited removal is a legal term by which a U.S. agency formally removes, or deports, someone without an appearance before an immigration judge. It also can be termed fast-track deportation . Either is acceptable, with an explanation. Some people are offered voluntary return or voluntary departure , which carry lesser consequences in exchange for agreeing to leave the country voluntarily. Avoid the term self-deportation , referring to people in a country illegally who leave without any pressure from authorities. In the United States, the Border Patrol uses the term turnback to refer to someone who enters the country illegally, turns around and leaves, typically in anticipation of being arrested by authorities. If the term is used, explain it. pushbacks Though there is no universally agreed-on definition, the term is used primarily in Europe to refer to the forcible return of migrants and refugees across an international border without an assessment of their rights to apply for asylum or other forms of protection. International law prohibits sending people back to a country where they risk being persecuted on certain grounds, including race, religion and political opinion. If the term is used, explain it. green card (n.), green-card (adj.) Acceptable in all references for a U.S. card showing an immigrant has permanent legal status. It is a required step toward becoming a naturalized citizen. Hyphenate as a modifier: green-card holder . sanctuaries, sanctuary jurisdictions Local and state governments that limit cooperation with federal immigration authorities. There are no firm criteria for what qualifies a jurisdiction as sanctuary . Some are self-described that way as a matter of pride, while those who favor immigration restrictions use the label as criticism. Provide details in each situation. visas The general term often suffices for documents showing permission to visit, work or study in another country. If relevant, use the classification and/or a brief description. For example: H-1B visas used for high-tech workers or visas used for high-tech workers . More detail is here: https://travel.state.gov/content/travel/en/us-visas/visa-information-resources/all-visa-categories.html . immigration detention centers, detention facilities, immigration jails, holding facilities Among the terms for places where people are held for reasons related to immigration status and are not free to leave. Conditions vary considerably, from modern prisons fully equipped with medical services to makeshift campsites. Choose the term that seems to best apply, be as descriptive as possible and name the managing agency. In the United States, the Department of Health and Human Services manages what it calls shelters for unaccompanied migrant children. Avoid the term unless in direct quotations. Instead: holding facilities . immigration raid Use the term raid only when there is a major show of force, such as a large number of officials with guns drawn or forced entry into a home or business with a judicial order. Avoid sweep, which may be interpreted to mean removal of something undesirable. Operation is an acceptable term but be specific as possible in describing what happened. For example: The arrests were made outside homes and in traffic stops . human smuggling/people smuggling, human trafficking/people trafficking Human smuggling or people smuggling typically involves transporting people across an international border illegally, and with their consent, in exchange for a fee. Human trafficking or people trafficking involves the use of force or coercion, typically for labor or commercial sex. Make clear what type of trafficking is involved or alleged in a given situation. No hyphen in the modifiers: a suspected people smuggling operation; a human trafficking gang . arrests, apprehensions, encounters In the United States, Customs and Border Protection has historically reported apprehensions , which is synonymous with arrests , as a primary barometer of illegal crossings. Either term is acceptable. Figures for arrests and apprehensions are not synonymous with the number of people arrested; some have more than one arrest during the specified time period. Under authority derived from the coronavirus pandemic, CBP began using the term encounters to describe the number of times it stopped migrants because those expelled under those powers were not formally arrested. Limit use of the term; instead, stops or stopped xx number of times . Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals program A program introduced by then-President Barack Obama in 2012 that has allowed hundreds of thousands of people who were brought to the United States as children to temporarily remain in the country and obtain work permits. It does not confer legal status but provides protection from deportation. The program has survived legal challenges but faced an uncertain future as of July 2021, when a federal judge prohibited new enrollments but invited President Joe Biden’s administration to make another attempt to pass legal muster. Use the acronym DACA sparingly and only on second reference. “Dreamers” An often-used term for people who were brought to the United States illegally as children by family. The term is derived from never-passed legislation called the DREAM Act, short for Development, Relief and Education for Alien Minors. It would have allowed young immigrants in the United States illegally who were brought to the country as children to remain if they met certain criteria. Some also use the term “Dreamers” for those covered under the Obama-era Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals act. That program, known as DACA, continues for those who have or had  DACA status but was closed to new applicants in July 2021. The program does not convey legal status but conveys temporary protection from deportation and permission to legally work, similar to protections offered under DREAM Act proposals. Use the term “Dreamers” sparingly and in quotation marks in all references. Define the term soon after use: They are commonly referred to as “Dreamers,” based on never-passed proposals in Congress called the DREAM Act . — U.S. IMMIGRATION LAW ENFORCEMENT AND AGENCIES The departments of Homeland Security, Justice , and Health and Human Services play key roles in immigration in the United States. Many who come to the United States encounter any or all of these departments and perhaps multiple agencies within them. Strike a balance to sufficiently identify agencies without a jumble of names and abbreviations that may be difficult for readers to follow. When appropriate, use U.S. authorities or U.S. immigration authorities to avoid having to distinguish between departments and agencies. Here is more detail, for use when needed: The Department of Health and Human Services , through its Office of Refugee Resettlement , is responsible for taking custody of unaccompanied children within 72 hours and placing them with “sponsors” in the United States, most often parents or close relatives. HHS is acceptable on second reference if needed to avoid confusion with other departments in a story. Use the department if only one is mentioned. The Department of Justice operates immigration courts through its Executive Office for Immigration Review . The office employs judges and operates courtrooms. It is an administrative office within the Justice Department, not part of the independent judiciary. Judges are under guidance of the attorney general and the immigration review office’s Board of Immigration Appeals . Generally use immigration courts . If appropriate, mention that immigration courts are an administrative agency within the Justice Department. Use Executive Office for Immigration Review if it is part of a person’s job title. Do not use EOIR . Immigrants are called respondents in immigration court. Avoid the jargon but do not use defendant . Instead: immigrants, people seeking to remain in the U.S., asylum-seekers (if applicable). Homeland Security attorneys represent the government. Call them government lawyers , not prosecutors . The Department of Homeland Security has three agencies dealing with immigration: U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement, U.S. Customs and Border Protection , and U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services . Generally use the relevant agency name on first reference, rather than the Homeland Security Department , since these agencies are commonly recognized by readers. The abbreviations ICE, CBP and USCIS may be used in headlines and sparingly on second reference. For stories on the Homeland Security Department, DHS may be used in headlines, and on second reference if needed to avoid confusion with other departments in a story. Use the department if only one is mentioned. For stories on U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement, U.S. Customs and Border Protection , and U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services , generally avoid references to units within them on second reference if possible. If it is necessary to refer to a specific unit, here are some details: U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement has two main units: Homeland Security Investigations and Enforcement and Removal Operations : — Homeland Security Investigations Investigates any criminal activity that crosses international lines, which includes trafficking of humans or goods; money laundering; and cybersecurity, intellectual property theft and trade fraud. HSI is acceptable on second reference if necessary. Do not call it Homeland Security . Explain in the story that it is a unit of Immigration and Customs Enforcement . It employs agents ; do not call them officers . — Enforcement and Removal Operations Arrests and detains people in the U.S. illegally and returns them to their homelands by chartered or commercial flights or through a land crossing with Mexico or Canada. The agency manages the world’s largest immigration detention system. Its fugitive operations teams go into communities to arrest people, but it mostly relies on city, county and state law enforcement agencies to turn over people who are booked into jail and flagged in databases as wanted by immigration authorities. What some call sanctuary jurisdictions have varying degrees of limitations on the extent of cooperation with immigration authorities. ERO is acceptable on second reference if necessary. Explain in the story that it is a unit of Immigration and Customs Enforcement . It employs officers ; do not call them agents . ICE also has an Office of Principal Legal Advisor that, among other things, represents Homeland Security in immigration court. U.S. Customs and Border Protection holds people for up to 72 hours in jails or holding cells . Do not call them detention centers , which implies they are designed for longer-term custody. CBP is acceptable on second reference when necessary to distinguish from other agencies. Do not use the stand-alone terms Customs or customs in reference to this agency. CBP includes the Border Patrol , the Office of Field Operations , and the Office of Air and Marine . The Border Patrol polices areas outside the more than 300 official land crossings, airports and sea landings. Its employees are agents ; do not call them officers . The Office of Field Operations polices all official ports of entry to the United States, including land crossings, airports and sea landings. Its employees are officers ; do not call them agents . They may be referred to generically as border inspectors or airport inspectors . U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services grants citizenship, green cards, temporary work visas and other immigration benefits. Its asylum officers screen applicants and may decide cases. — INTERNATIONAL AGENCIES Frontex The European Union agency tasked with helping member states protect the EU’s external borders. Based in Warsaw, Poland. Its formal name is the European Border and Coast Guard Agency, but it is widely known as Frontex, an acronym derived from its name in French. EU countries are responsible for protecting their own borders, but Frontex can assist countries facing intense migratory pressure with border guards, aircraft, boats, surveillance technology and other equipment. It can also assist EU member states with deportations. International Organization for Migration An intergovernmental, U.N.-related organization based in Geneva, promoting international cooperation on migration, advising governments on migration issues and providing humanitarian assistance to migrants in need. IOM is acceptable on second reference. UNHCR Acceptable in all references for the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees, with a brief explanation that it is the U.N. refugee agency: UNHCR, the U.N. refugee agency . The agency, based in Geneva, protects and assists displaced people around the world. The abbreviation UNHCR now refers to the agency as a whole, rather than just the commissioner. The head of the agency is the U.N. high commissioner for refugees ; the term U.N. refugee chief is also acceptable."}

The term driverless should not be used unless there is no human backup driver.\nAs of early 2024, there were no autonomous vehicles for sale to the public in the U.S. Some autonomous vehicles are in use by ride-hailing and goods-delivery services. Autonomous semis are being tested. If a human is expected to supervise or take action, the vehicle is not autonomous. In cases where a company is testing what it considers to be an autonomous vehicle on public roads with a human driver supervising, this should be called an autonomous test vehicle . Some vehicles have driver-assist systems that can perform tasks such as changing lanes, driving at low speeds, or keeping a safe distance from vehicles ahead of them, but they still need human supervision. These should be referred to as partially automated . Avoid the term semiautonomous , because it implies that these systems can drive themselves. As of early 2024, human drivers must be ready to intervene at any time. Nearly all automakers now sell their own version of partially automated driving systems. Some of the best known are Tesla’s Autopilot , General Motors’ Super Cruise and Nissan’s ProPilot Assist . Autopilot, ProPilot Assist and other trade names should be capitalized; the generic use of autopilot is lowercase."}

{"source_url": "https://www.apstylebook.com/ap_stylebook/semicolon-2", "entry_header": "semicolon (;)", "text_content": "In general, use the semicolon to indicate a greater separation of thought and information than a comma can convey but less than the separation that a period implies. The basic guidelines: TO CLARIFY A SERIES: Use semicolons to separate elements of a series when the items in the series are long or when individual segments contain material that also must be set off by commas: He is survived by a son, John Smith, of Chicago; three daughters, Jane Smith, of Wichita, Kansas, Mary Smith, of Denver, and Susan, of Boston; and a sister, Martha, of Omaha, Nebraska. Note that the semicolon is used before the final and in such a series. Another application of this principle may be seen in the cross-references at the end of entries in this book. Because some entries themselves have a comma, a semicolon is used to separate references to multiple entries, as in: See the felony, misdemeanor entry ; pardon, parole, probation ; and prison, jail . See dash for a different type of connection that uses dashes to avoid multiple commas. TO LINK INDEPENDENT CLAUSES: Use semicolon when a coordinating conjunction such as and , but or for is not present: The package was due last week; it arrived today. If a coordinating conjunction is present, use a semicolon before it only if extensive punctuation also is required in one or more of the individual clauses: They pulled their boats from the water, sandbagged the retaining walls, and boarded up the windows; but even with these precautions, the island was hard-hit by the hurricane. Unless a particular literary effect is desired, however, the better approach in these circumstances is to break the independent clauses into separate sentences. PLACEMENT WITH QUOTES: Place semicolons outside quotation marks."}

INTERPOLATED QUESTION: You told me – Did I hear you correctly? – that you started the riot. MULTIPLE QUESTIONS: Use a single question mark at the end of the full sentence: Did you hear him say, \"What right have you to ask about the riot?\" Did he plan the riot, employ assistants, and give the signal to begin? Or, to cause full stops and throw emphasis on each element, break into separate sentences: Did he plan the riot? Employ assistants? Give the signal to begin?

Try to write it another way. If a sentence must contain incidental material, then commas or two dashes are frequently more effective. Use these alternatives whenever possible. There are occasions, however, when parentheses are the only effective means of inserting necessary background or reference information. When they are necessary, follow these guidelines: WITHIN QUOTATIONS: If parenthetical information inserted in a direct quotation is at all sensitive, place an editor's note under a dash at the bottom of a story alerting copy desks to what was inserted. PUNCTUATION: Place a period outside a closing parenthesis if the material inside is not a sentence ( such as this fragment ). ( An independent parenthetical sentence such as this one takes a period before the closing parenthesis. ) When a phrase placed in parentheses ( this one is an example ) might normally qualify as a complete sentence but is dependent on the surrounding material, do not capitalize the first word or end with a period. INSERTIONS IN A PROPER NAME: Use parentheses if a state name or similar information is inserted within a proper name: The Huntsville (Alabama) Times . But use commas if no proper name is involved: The Selma, Alabama, group saw the governor. NEVER USED: Do not use parentheses to denote a political figure's party affiliation and jurisdiction.

Use an ellipsis to indicate the deletion of one or more words in condensing quotations, texts and documents. Be especially careful to avoid deletions that would distort the meaning. An ellipsis also may be used to indicate a thought that the speaker or writer does not complete. Substitute a dash for this purpose, however, if the context uses ellipses to indicate that words actually spoken or written have been deleted. Brief examples of how to use ellipses are provided after guidelines are given. More extensive examples, drawn from the speech in which President Richard Nixon announced his resignation, are in the sections below marked CONDENSATION EXAMPLE and QUOTATIONS . PUNCTUATION GUIDELINES: If the words that precede an ellipsis constitute a grammatically complete sentence, either in the original or in the condensation, place a period at the end of the last word before the ellipsis. Follow it with a regular space and an ellipsis: I no longer have a strong enough political base. ... When the grammatical sense calls for a question mark, exclamation point, comma or colon, the sequence is word, punctuation mark, regular space, ellipsis: Will you come? ... When material is deleted at the end of one paragraph and at the beginning of the one that follows, place an ellipsis in both locations. CONDENSATION EXAMPLE: Here is an example of how the spacing and punctuation guidelines would be applied in condensing President Richard Nixon's resignation announcement: Good evening. ... In all the decisions I have made in my public life, I have always tried to do what was best for the nation. ... ... However, it has become evident to me that I no longer have a strong enough political base in ... Congress. ... As long as there was ... a base, I felt strongly that it was necessary to see the constitutional process through to its conclusion, that to do otherwise would be ... a dangerously destabilizing precedent for the future. QUOTATIONS: In writing a story, do not use ellipses at the beginning or end of direct quotes: \"It has become evident to me that I no longer have a strong enough political base,\" Nixon said. Not \"... it has become evident to me that I no longer have a strong enough political base ... ,\" Nixon said. SPECIAL EFFECTS: Ellipses also may be used to separate individual items within a paragraph of show business gossip or similar material. Use periods after items that are complete sentences."}

SERIES WITHIN A PHRASE: When a phrase that otherwise would be set off by commas contains a series of words that must be separated by commas, use dashes to set off the full phrase: He listed the qualities — intelligence, humor, conservatism, independence — that he liked in an executive.

Even if the meaning is not changed, bad punctuation, however inconsequential, can cause the reader to lose track of what is being said and give up reading a sentence. The basic guideline is to use common sense. –Punctuation is to make clear the thought being expressed. –If punctuation does not help make clear what is being said, it should not be there. \"The Elements of Style\" by William Strunk Jr. and E.B. White says: \"Clarity, clarity, clarity. When you become hopelessly mired in a sentence, it is best to start fresh; do not try to fight your way through against the terrible odds of syntax. Usually what is wrong is that the construction has become too involved at some point; the sentence needs to be broken apart and replaced by two or more shorter sentences.\" This applies to punctuation. If a sentence becomes cluttered with commas, semicolons and dashes, start over. These two paragraphs are full of commas and clauses; all of it equals too much for the reader to grasp: The Commonwealth Games Federation, in an apparent effort to persuade other nations to ignore the spiraling boycott, ruled Sunday that Budd, a runner who has had a storied past on and off the track, and Cowley, a swimmer who competes for the University of Texas, were ineligible under the Commonwealth Constitution to compete for England in the 10-day event to be held in Edinburgh, Scotland, beginning July 24. The decision on Budd, who has been the object of a number of demonstrations in the past, and Cowley followed an earlier announcement Sunday by Tanzania that it was joining Nigeria, Kenya, Ghana and Uganda in boycotting the games because of Britain's refusal to support economic sanctions against South Africa's government."}

{"source_url": "https://www.apstylebook.com/ap_stylebook/quotation-marks-2", "entry_header": "quotation marks (\" \")", "text_content": "The basic guidelines for open-quote marks (\") and close-quote marks (\"): FOR DIRECT QUOTATIONS: To surround the exact words of a speaker or writer when reported in a story: \"I have no intention of staying,\" he replied. \"I do not object,\" he said, \"to the tenor of the report.\" Franklin said, \"A penny saved is a penny earned.\" A speculator said the practice is \"too conservative for inflationary times.\" RUNNING QUOTATIONS: If a full paragraph of quoted material is followed by a paragraph that continues the quotation, do not put close-quote marks at the end of the first paragraph. Do, however, put open-quote marks at the start of the second paragraph. Continue in this fashion for any succeeding paragraphs, using close-quote marks only at the end of the quoted material. If a paragraph does not start with quotation marks but ends with a quotation that is continued in the next paragraph, do not use close-quote marks at the end of the introductory paragraph if the quoted material constitutes a full sentence. Use close-quote marks, however, if the quoted material does not constitute a full sentence. For example: He said, \"I am shocked and horrified by the slaying. \"I am so horrified, in fact, that I will ask for the death penalty.\" But: He said he was \"shocked and horrified by the slaying.\" \"I am so horrified, in fact, that I will ask for the death penalty,\" he said. DIALOGUE OR CONVERSATION: Each person's words, no matter how brief, are placed in a separate paragraph, with quotation marks at the beginning and the end of each person's speech: \"Will you go?\" \"Yes.\" \"When?\" \"Thursday.\" NOT IN Q-and-A: Quotation marks are not required in formats that identify questions and answers by Q : and A :. See question mark for example. NOT IN TEXTS: Quotation marks are not required in full texts, condensed texts or textual excerpts. See ellipsis . COMPOSITION TITLES: See composition titles for guidelines on the use of quotation marks in book titles, movie titles, etc. NICKNAMES: See pseudonyms, nicknames . IRONY: Put quotation marks around a word or words used in an ironical sense: The \"debate\" turned into a free-for-all. UNFAMILIAR TERMS: A word or words being introduced to readers may be placed in quotation marks on first reference: Broadcast frequencies are measured in \"kilohertz.\" Do not put subsequent references to kilohertz in quotation marks. See foreign words . AVOID UNNECESSARY FRAGMENTS: Do not use quotation marks to report a few ordinary words that a speaker or writer has used: Wrong: The senator said he would \"go home to Michigan\" if he lost the election. Right: The senator said he would go home to Michigan if he lost the election. PARTIAL QUOTES: When a partial quote is used, do not put quotation marks around words that the speaker could not have used. Suppose the individual said, \"I am horrified at your slovenly manners.\" Wrong: She said she \"was horrified at their slovenly manners.\" Right: She said she was horrified at their \"slovenly manners.\" Better when practical: Use the full quote. QUOTES WITHIN QUOTES: Alternate between double quotation marks (\"or\") and single marks ('or'): She said, \"I quote from his letter, 'I agree with Kipling that \"the female of the species is more deadly than the male,\" but the phenomenon is not an unchangeable law of nature,' a remark he did not explain.\" Use three marks together if two quoted elements end at the same time: She said, \"He told me, 'I love you.'\" PLACEMENT WITH OTHER PUNCTUATION: Follow these long-established printers' rules: The period and the comma always go within the quotation marks. The dash, the semicolon, the colon, the question mark and the exclamation point go within the quotation marks when they apply to the quoted matter only. They go outside when they apply to the whole sentence. HEADLINES: Use single quote marks in headlines. See comma ."}
{"source_url": "https://www.apstylebook.com/ap_stylebook/prefixes", "entry_header": "prefixes", "text_content": "The Stylebook’s preferences on whether to use a hyphen following a prefix are based largely on Merriam-Webster. Generally we do not hyphenate. But there are exceptions. A 2024 change: We no longer generally use a hyphen with these prefixes: out-, post-, pre-, re- . Previous guidance was to use a hyphen with those unless listed separately in the dictionary. This change aligns style on those prefixes both with our overall guidance and with Merriam-Webster. Another 2024 change: no hyphen in semiautomatic and semiautonomous , adding those to the other no-hyphen semi- constructions. In addition: While we now generally don’t use a hyphen in anti- constructions (a 2024 change), there are a number of exceptions to align with Merriam-Webster. Three rules are constant: Use a hyphen if the prefix ends in a vowel and the word that follows begins with the same vowel. Exceptions: cooperate, coordinate , and double-e combinations such as preestablish, preeminent, reenact, reelect . Use a hyphen if the word that follows is capitalized: un-American , for example. Use a hyphen to join doubled prefixes: sub-subparagraph . Here is the style for some commonly used prefixes. (Measurement-related prefixes such as centi- and milli- are listed individually in the book.) In general, no hyphen with these prefixes except as noted in the above three rules: a- ante- anti- Generally no hyphen is a 2024 change for consistency. But note a number of exceptions. They include: anti-abortion, anti-aggression, anti-apartheid, anti-collision, anti-corruption, anti-cruelty, anti-labor, anti-racist, anti-racketeering, anti-secrecy, anti-terrorism, anti-war . arch- after- Generally no hyphen after this prefix when it is used to form a noun: aftertaste, afterlife, aftermarket . Exception: after-party . Follow after- with a hyphen when it is used to form compound modifiers: after-tax results, after-work celebration . bi- by- Exception: by-election . counter- dis- down- ex- No hyphen for words that use ex- in the sense of out of , such as excommunicate . Hyphenate when using ex- in the sense of former , such as ex-president . Do not capitalize ex- when attached to a formal title before a name: ex-President Barack Obama . The prefix modifies the entire term: ex-New York Gov. Mario Cuomo ; not New York ex-Gov . Usually former is better. extra- No hyphen when extra means outside of : extralegal, extraterrestrial, extramarital . Follow extra- with a hyphen when it is part of a compound modifier describing a condition beyond the usual size, extent or degree: extra-base hit, extra-large book . fore- No hyphen except for these nautical exceptions, based on long-standing practice: fore-topgallant, fore-topsail, fore-topmast . hydro- hyper- in- In general, no hyphen when it means not ( inaccurate, insufferable ). Other uses without a hyphen: inbound, infighting, indoor, inpatient, infield . A few combinations take a hyphen, however, including in-depth, in-house, in-group, in-law . infra- inter- intra- mega- micro- mid- In addition to the general rules for prefixes, use a hyphen when a figure follows: mid-30s . mini- multi- non- out- Generally no hyphen is a 2024 change for consistency. over- post- Generally no hyphen is a 2024 change for consistency. pre- Generally no hyphen is a 2024 change for consistency. re- Generally no hyphen is a 2024 change for consistency. For some words, the sense is the governing factor: recover ( regain ); re-cover ( cover again ); recreate ( relax ); re-create ( create again ); resign ( quit ); re-sign ( sign again ). semi- This includes no hyphen in semiautomatic and semiautonomous ; style on those two words changed in 2024 for consistency. sub- super- supra- trans- ultra- under- un- up- In addition, no hyphen with measurement-related prefixes such as centi- and milli- . See separate entries with more detail on those. Generally use a hyphen with these prefixes unless listed without a hyphen in Merriam-Webster: all- full- half- Hyphenated combinations include half-baked, half-life, half-truth, half-moon, half-cocked, half-hearted (the latter a 2024 change). Two-word combinations without a hyphen include half dozen, half brother, half off . One word, no hyphen, for some words including halfback, halftone . Also: halftime as a noun, in keeping with widespread practice in sports copy. But half-time as an adjective outside sports contexts. like- Follow with a hyphen when used as a prefix meaning similar to : like-minded, like-natured . No hyphen in words that have meanings of their own: likelihood, likewise, likeness . off- Follow Merriam-Webster. Some examples: offbeat, offhand, offline, offset, offshore, off-brand, off-key, off-limits, off-load . pan- Most combinations with pan- are proper nouns. Use a hyphen with those, and capitalize both pan- and the proper name it is combined with: Pan-African, Pan-American . No hyphen when combined with a common noun: panchromatic . part- pro- self- Always hyphenate: self-assured, self-government, self-defense wide- Follow Merriam-Webster. Usually hyphenated. Some examples: wide-angle, wide-eyed, wide-awake, wide-open . Exception: widespread . An exception to Merriam-Webster: co- Use a hyphen for nouns, adjectives and verbs that indicate occupation or status: co-author, co-chair, co-defendant, co-host, co-pilot, co-star, co-worker . As part of a formal title before a name: co-President Alexa Manola, co-Executive Director Alfredo Hudson . Use no hyphen in other combinations: coeducation, coexist, cooperative (but co-op ), copay . Cooperate, coordinate and related words are exceptions to the rule that a hyphen is used if a prefix ends in a vowel and the word that follows begins with the same vowel. Co-op retains the hyphen to avoid confusion with a chicken’s home. No hyphen in coworking when the meaning is sharing workspace and amenities, such as Wi-Fi, a printer, fax machine and the like, when people don’t actually work for the same company but instead are self-employed or remote workers."}
{"source_url": "https://www.apstylebook.com/ap_stylebook/possessives", "entry_header": "possessives", "text_content": "Follow these guidelines: PLURAL NOUNS NOT ENDING IN S: Add 's : the alumni's contributions , women's rights . PLURAL NOUNS ENDING IN S: Add only an apostrophe: the churches' needs , the girls' toys , the horses' food , the ships' wake , states' rights , the VIPs' entrance . NOUNS PLURAL IN FORM, SINGULAR IN MEANING: Add only an apostrophe: mathematics' rules , measles' effects . (But see INANIMATE OBJECTS below.) Apply the same principle when a plural word occurs in the formal name of a singular entity: General Motors' profits , the United States' wealth . NOUNS THE SAME IN SINGULAR AND PLURAL: Treat them the same as plurals, even if the meaning is singular: one corps' location , the two deer's tracks , the lone moose's antlers . SINGULAR NOUNS NOT ENDING IN S: Add 's : the church's needs , the girl's toys , the horse's food , the ship's route , the VIP's seat . Some style guides say that singular nouns ending in s sounds such as ce , x , and z may take either the apostrophe alone or 's . See SPECIAL EXPRESSIONS , but otherwise, for consistency and ease in remembering a rule, always use 's if the word does not end in the letter s : Butz's policies , the fox's den , the justice's verdict , Marx's theories , the prince's life , Xerox's profits . SINGULAR COMMON NOUNS ENDING IN S: Add ’s : the virus’s reach, the virus’s spread; the witness’s answer, the witness’s story . (A change from previous guidance calling for just an apostrophe if the next word begins with s .) SINGULAR PROPER NAMES ENDING IN S: Use only an apostrophe: Achilles' heel , Agnes' book , Ceres' rites , Descartes' theories , Dickens' novels , Euripides' dramas , Hercules' labors , Jesus' life , Jules' seat , Kansas' schools , Moses' law , Socrates' life , Tennessee Williams' plays , Xerxes' armies . SPECIAL EXPRESSIONS: The following exceptions to the general rule for words not ending in s apply to words that end in an s sound and are followed by a word that begins with s : for appearance' sake , for conscience' sake , for goodness' sake . Use 's otherwise: the appearance's cost , my conscience's voice . PRONOUNS: Personal interrogative and relative pronouns have separate forms for the possessive. None involve an apostrophe: mine , ours , your , yours , his , hers , its , theirs , whose . Caution: If you are using an apostrophe with a pronoun, always double-check to be sure that the meaning calls for a contraction: you're , it's , there's , who's . Follow the rules listed above in forming the possessives of other pronouns: another's idea , others' plans , someone's guess . COMPOUND WORDS: Applying the rules above, add an apostrophe or 's to the word closest to the object possessed: the major general's decision , the major generals' decisions , the attorney general's request , the attorneys general's request . See the plurals entry for guidelines on forming the plurals of these words. Also: anyone else's attitude , John Adams Jr.'s father , Benjamin Franklin of Pennsylvania's motion . Whenever practical, however, recast the phrase to avoid ambiguity: the motion by Benjamin Franklin of Pennsylvania . JOINT POSSESSION, INDIVIDUAL POSSESSION: Use a possessive form after only the last word if ownership is joint: Desmond and Molly's apartment , Desmond and Molly's stocks . Use a possessive form after both words if the objects are individually owned: Desmond's and Molly's books . DESCRIPTIVE PHRASES: Do not add an apostrophe to a word ending in s when it is used primarily in a descriptive sense: citizens band radio , a Cincinnati Reds infielder , a teachers college , a Teamsters request , a writers guide . Memory aid: The apostrophe usually is not used if for or by rather than of would be appropriate in the longer form: a radio band for citizens , a college for teachers , a guide for writers , a request by the Teamsters . An 's is required, however, when a term involves a plural word that does not end in s : a children's hospital , a people's republic , the Young Men's Christian Association . DESCRIPTIVE NAMES: Some governmental, corporate and institutional organizations with a descriptive word in their names use an apostrophe; some do not. Follow the user's practice: Actors' Equity , Diners Club , Ladies' Home Journal , the National Governors Association . QUASI POSSESSIVES: Follow the rules above in composing the possessive form of words that occur in such phrases as a day's pay, two weeks' vacation, three months' work, five years' probation . The apostrophe is used with a measurement followed by a noun (a quantity of whatever the noun is). The examples could be rephrased as a day of pay, two weeks of vacation, three months of work, five years of probation. No apostrophe when the quantity precedes an adjective: six months pregnant, three weeks overdue, 11 years old . DOUBLE POSSESSIVE: Two conditions must apply for a double possessive — a phrase such as a friend of John's — to occur: 1. The word after of must refer to an animate object, and 2. The word before of must involve only a portion of the animate object's possessions. Otherwise, do not use the possessive form of the word after of : The friends of John Adams mourned his death. (All the friends were involved.) He is a friend of the college. (Not college's , because college is inanimate.) Memory aid: This construction occurs most often, and quite naturally, with the possessive forms of personal pronouns: He is a friend of mine. INANIMATE OBJECTS: There is no blanket rule against creating a possessive form for an inanimate object, particularly if the object is treated in a personified sense. See some of the earlier examples, and note these: death's call , the wind's murmur . In general, however, avoid excessive personalization of inanimate objects, and give preference to an of construction when it fits the makeup of the sentence. For example, the earlier references to mathematics' rules and measles' effects would better be phrased: the rules of mathematics , the effects of measles ."}

Use a capital letter only if you can justify it by one of the principles listed here. Many words and phrases, including special cases, are listed separately in this book. Entries that are capitalized without further comment should be capitalized in all uses. If there is no relevant listing in this book for a particular word or phrase, consult Merriam-Webster. Use lowercase if the dictionary lists it as an acceptable form for the sense in which the word is being used. As used in this book, capitalize means to use uppercase for the first letter of a word. If additional capital letters are needed, they are called for by an example or a phrase such as use all caps . Some basic principles: PROPER NOUNS: Capitalize nouns that constitute the unique identification for a specific person, place, or thing: John , Fatima , Mexico , Boston , England . Some words, such as the examples just given, are always proper nouns. Some common nouns receive proper noun status when they are used as the name of a particular entity: General Electric , Gulf Oil . PROPER NAMES: Capitalize common nouns such as party , river , street and west when they are an integral part of the full name for a person, place or thing: Democratic Party , Mississippi River , Fleet Street , West Virginia . Lowercase these common nouns when they stand alone in subsequent references: the party , the river , the street . Lowercase the common noun elements of names in plural uses: the Democratic and Republican parties, Main and State streets, lakes Erie and Ontario . Exception: plurals of formal titles with full names are capitalized: Presidents Jimmy Carter and Gerald R. Ford . Among entries that provide additional guidelines are: animals holidays and holy days brand names legislature building months committee monuments Congress nicknames datelines organizations and institutions days of the week planets directions and regions plants food police department geographic names religious references governmental bodies seasons heavenly bodies trademarks historical periods and events unions POPULAR NAMES: Some places and events lack officially designated proper names but have popular names that are the effective equivalent: the Main Line (a group of Philadelphia suburbs), the South Side (of Chicago), the Badlands (of South Dakota), the Street (the financial community in the Wall Street area of New York). The principle applies also to shortened versions of the proper names of one-of-a-kind events: the Series (for the World Series), the Derby (for the Kentucky Derby). This practice should not, however, be interpreted as a license to ignore the general practice of lowercasing the common noun elements of a name when they stand alone. FAMILY NAMES: Capitalize words denoting family relationships when they substitute for a person's name: I wrote Mom a letter. I wrote my father a letter . INFORMAL NAMES: Capitalize words such as professor, doctor, coach , etc., when they substitute for a person’s name: What’s the diagnosis, Doctor? Put me in, Coach! She asked her doctor for a diagnosis. DERIVATIVES: Capitalize words that are derived from a proper noun and still depend on it for their meaning: American , Christian , Christianity , English , French , Marxism , Shakespearean . Lowercase words that are derived from a proper noun but no longer depend on it for their meaning: french fries , herculean , malapropism , pasteurize , quixotic , venetian blind . SENTENCES: Capitalize the first word in a statement that stands as a sentence. See sentences and parentheses . In poetry, capital letters are used for the first words of some phrases that would not be capitalized in prose. See poetry . COMPOSITIONS: Capitalize the principal words in the names of books, movies, plays, poems, operas, songs, radio and television programs, works of art, etc. See composition titles , magazine names and newspaper names . TITLES: Capitalize formal titles when used immediately before a name. Lowercase formal titles when used alone or in constructions that set them off from a name by commas. Use lowercase at all times for terms that are job descriptions rather than formal titles. See academic titles , legislative titles , military titles , nobility , religious titles and titles .

Generally, we do not identify people under 18 who are accused of crimes, or transmit images that would reveal their identity. However, managers may authorize exceptions. Considerations in granting exceptions may include the severity of the crime or alleged crime; whether police have formally released the suspect's name; and whether the person has been formally charged as an adult. Other considerations might include public safety, such as when the youth is the subject of a search; or widespread publication of the suspect's name, making the identity de facto public knowledge. In some situations, state or national laws may determine whether the person's name can be published. We normally do not identify, in text or through images, people under 18 who are witnesses to crimes. We also do not identify, in text or through images, people who may have been sexually assaulted (unless they have come forward and voluntarily identified themselves). We should also use discretion in naming victims of other extremely severe abuse. Sometimes a person may be identified by AP in an abduction or search situation, and it develops later that — because of a sexual assault or other reason — the name should not be used. In such cases we have sometimes refrained from using the identification in future coverage. We do not name suspects or transmit images of them in brief stories about minor crimes when there is little chance AP will cover the case beyond the initial arrest. We also do not link to local stories about such incidents where the arrested person's name or mug shot might be used.

The term riot suggests uncontrolled chaos and pandemonium. Focusing on rioting and property destruction rather than underlying grievance has been used in the past to stigmatize broad swaths of people protesting against lynching or police brutality or for racial justice, going back at least to the urban uprisings of the 1960s in the U.S. Inciting to riot is a longstanding criminal offense involving two or more people. In the United States, a federal criminal anti-riot act was enacted in 1968 in response to violent civil disturbances and protests of that era. Unrest is a vaguer, milder and less emotional term for a condition of angry discontent and protest verging on revolt. Protest and demonstration refer to specific actions such as marches, sit-ins, rallies or other actions meant to register dissent. They can be legal or illegal, organized or spontaneous, peaceful or violent, and involve any number of people.

Interpretations can vary widely. Do not simply repeat those terms. Instead, pay close attention to legal definitions, which vary by jurisdiction, and the wording of criminal charges or convictions. Consider the nuance of each situation and what may be conveyed or perceived by the language used. As with all accusations, allegations should be well documented and corroborated. Always seek comment from accused individuals or their representatives. We generally do not identify, in text or images, those who say they have been sexually assaulted or subjected to extreme abuse. We may identify victims of sexual assault or extreme abuse when victims publicly identify themselves. Decisions on identifying people who say they have been subject to other forms of sexual misconduct should be made on a case-by-case basis, depending on the nature of the allegations. Among points to consider: Terms such as rape, sexual assault and sexual harassment have legal definitions that vary by jurisdiction. Knowing the definitions is essential when deciding which term(s) are accurate and appropriate. Depending on state law, rape and sexual assault can include sexual contact by force, threat or coercion, or after the accuser's incapacitation due to drugs or alcohol. When reporting on court cases, use the language contained in the charges and/or conviction. If a defendant is charged with sexual assault , do not say he is charged with rape . If a defendant is convicted on a charge of sexual misconduct , do not say he was convicted of having unwanted sex with the victim or convicted of rape . If someone is charged with sexual harassment , do not say they are accused of sexual assault . It may be appropriate to explain why a story does or does not use certain terms: The woman said she was raped; prosecutors charged the man with sexual assault under the definitions in state law. Another example: He was convicted of taking indecent liberties, which is the formal criminal charge . The term sexual relationship implies consent. Under state laws, a minor cannot give sexual consent to an adult. Thus, do not write that an adult had a sexual relationship with or had sex with a minor or vice versa. (The age of consent varies by jurisdiction; know the law of the state or jurisdiction in question.) In other cases, consider carefully whether relationship is an appropriate term. A key issue in many cases is the element of consent, and definitions of what constitutes consent vary. Refer to the laws of the jurisdiction in question. The terms sexual harassment and sexual misconduct generally denote behavior that does not include rape, sexual assault, sexual abuse or sexual violence . Sexual misconduct is preferred over sexual harassment , as it encompasses a broader range of misbehavior and does not run the risk of diminishing an alleged act. Use sexual harassment when reporting on a specific legal charge or formal Equal Employment Opportunity Commission complaint. The term sexual violence may occasionally be used in broad references to sexual assault, rape and sexual abuse . Use the more specific wording for individual cases. After using a broad term such as sexual misconduct or sexual assault , describe generally the kinds of behavior alleged or admitted to — such as groping, unwanted kissing, disrobing, verbal abuse, digital penetration, oral sex, etc. Provide enough detail to make clear the alleged crimes, while avoiding a level of detail that could be perceived as gratuitous. Do not refer to a person making an accusation as a victim unless the accused person has been convicted. Avoid the term alleged victim . The term accuser is acceptable, especially when referring to a group of people: Bill Cosby's accusers . Limit its use when referring to an individual in favor of the correct pronoun. The woman said the defendant forcibly kissed her . RESOURCES : https://www.eeoc.gov/harassment https://apps.rainn.org/policy/ See anonymous sources ; privacy ."}

Use more specific terms like prostitute, dancer, stripper, porn performer, online performer , etc., if needed for clarity or if the subjects describe themselves as such. Also use more specific descriptions of a situation, such as trafficking , if needed. Use prostitute and prostitution if those are the terms used in quotations, criminal charges, legislation, etc. Supporters of the term sex work argue that the phrasing provides dignity to people using the means available to them for survival and lessens the shame associated with a universally acknowledged but long-stigmatized line of work. Detractors of the terminology note that activities described as sex work — particularly prostitution — can involve coercion, exploitation, trafficking or slavery, and that minors are unable to legally consent to such \"work.\" Avoid terms like child prostitute or underage sex worker that can suggest a child is voluntarily trading sex for money. Though some underage people seek out sex work for financial support, they are in most cases not legally able to consent to sex. Instead, use specific phrasing that conveys context and relevance. Avoid escort as a synonym for prostitute . Escorts are often paid for their time or companionship instead of or in addition to sexual services.

Right there, you can see why they are so difficult to shun: Cliches are the junk food of the literary pantry, much loved by lazy writers. But platitudes and shopworn phrases serve as signals to the reader to move along, there’s nothing to see here. Don’t push readers away, or lull them to sleep. Engage them with original, specific phrasing. Jargon presents other issues. It has its place in specialized worlds whose inhabitants use jargon-speak as shortcuts (and sometimes, as code words for those in the know, or as tools to disguise, euphemize or editorialize). To a doctor, “symptomatology” is a patient’s set of symptoms; to a businessperson, “due diligence” is putting the necessary effort into research before making a decision; to a military officer, “collateral damage” is the accidental killing of innocent people. To the rest of us, these words may be befuddling. William Strunk Jr. and E.B. White put it simply in “The Elements of Style”: “Be clear.” Jargon is the opposite of clarity. Don’t just repeat the words. Translate them, and push for the true meaning when necessary. Here’s what not to do: COMMUNITIES: Pivoting from her image as cheerleader touting pricey government entitlements, Mayor Begonia Jargonne voiced profound dismay at plunging revenue enhancements as she pushed back against self-professed economists who fault her policies. In taking this proactive stance, the tree-lined community’s mayor aims to reach out to disgruntled constituents who have referenced her programs as irresponsible. To be sure, these critics had sanctioned such measures before, but more recently are dwelling on the mayor’s pressure points as a big spender. For her part, Jargonne proclaims that citizens soon will witness a sea change in budgetary matters in her drive to rally past their objections. Far from working under the radar, she vowed to commission a blue-ribbon commission, a game-changer that she said that would leave no leaf unturned at the end of the day in formulating shots in the arm for at-risk populations. GOVERNMENT: Exercising his bully pulpit, the president touted his executive orders as a dramatic, no-holds-barred way to target a laundry list of problems. But his reform proposals sparked a backlash from legislators who said the president had become the poster boy for executive overreach. The disagreement fueled a constitutional standoff on steroids that prompted both sides to take their grievances to court and poisoned the atmosphere. In a major policy address, the president took the bull by the horns and reached out to disaffected Americans, kicking off a campaign to win over their hearts and minds with a litany of proposals to reduce red tape and cut pork-barrel spending by thinking outside the box. Casting the proposals as a no-brainer, he said his plan would drill down to put more boots on the ground in ramping up the fight against waste, fraud and abuse. POLITICS: Taking no vote for granted, the candidate crisscrossed the country to take his campaign to key battleground states, where he issued a campaign manifesto with a 10-point funding plan that he had penned on his own. Still facing an uphill battle after failing to get much traction, he huddled with key advisers to map out a new blueprint that would take his campaign to the next level and broaden his support beyond his traditional lane with conservatives, who consider him a rock star. But the new narrative threatened to tarnish his brand as a truth-teller. After amassing a huge campaign war chest and zigzagging across the heartland, the candidate pressed the flesh as he sprinted to the finish line. In a time-honored tradition, voters trooped to the polls in droves on what promised to be a long night. The candidate holed up in a hotel with top advisers to await the results, which were up for grabs. BUSINESS: Buoyed by the ongoing efforts of a cutting-edge staff that doubled-down on achieving deliverables to replenish the conglomerate’s coffers, CEO Notso Frank — the company’s cheerleader-in-chief — downplayed wide-ranging, continuing warnings that the local economy was about to crash and burn. Joining a chorus of naysayers who have chimed in to shed a little daylight on the equities at risk, he said that after crunching the numbers and drilling down into the problem, he was hesitant to put the cart before the horse but that it appeared the company would weather the storm by the skin of its teeth and was working to avoid a worst-case scenario. That said, Frank acknowledged that his arsenal holds no Hail Mary moves to yield dividends any time soon. Without saying the P-word by name, he termed it a wake-up call for all bucket owners to grow their bandwidth and broaden their portfolios to avoid worst-case scenarios that could be toxic for the more upscale segments. POLICE AND COURTS: Police say an intoxicated person of interest suffered a self-inflicted gunshot to his left foot in an officer-involved shooting after being pulled over on suspicion of driving at a high rate of speed on a tree-lined street. Police Chief I.M. Kleeshay said responding officers, who were responding to the scene, said the unnamed suspect got into a physical and verbal altercation with them. A gun fired during the fracas, grazing him in the lower extremity. He was transported to a local hospital for treatment of his glancing toe blow, then remanded to be lodged in the local jail after which he may be bound over for trial. “A slay this wasn’t, but we must toe the line on gun crimes,” Kleeshay said. Authorities responded to an active shooter situation after students reported seeing a juvenile male discharging a firearm in a dormitory before fleeing the scene on foot. The dorm was fully engulfed in flames and two students were observed to be deceased. A short time later, law enforcement officers spotted an individual matching the description of the suspect walking down a nearby street and he was apprehended without incident."}

Survivor can denote someone who has lived through an injury or disease, but also can apply to someone who endured a threat but escaped injury altogether. Example: a mass shooting survivor . Likewise, victim can create confusion because it can variously mean someone killed, injured or subjected to mistreatment such as sexual misconduct. Be specific if there is room for confusion: The ceremony honored people wounded in the mass shooting , not The ceremony honored victims and/or survivors of the mass shooting . The play told the story of those killed in the hurricane , not The play told the stories of the hurricane's victims . Also be alert to potential biases and assumptions inherent in the word victim . A phrase such as AIDS victim , for instance, not only makes it unclear whether the subject is alive or dead, but many AIDS patients do not consider themselves victims. Instead, use neutral, precise descriptions: He has AIDS. She has hepatitis . In crime stories, avoid alleged victim if possible; it is too easily construed as skepticism. In stories in which sexual misconduct or other allegations are leveled, consider calling the person making the allegations an accuser instead of a victim if shorthand is needed, to avoid implications of guilt on the part of the accused. Survivor is often used to describe people who have lived through physical or emotional trauma, as in abuse or rape survivor . It is best to be specific when referring to individuals, especially if the person was never in danger of death. Use of survivor gets more latitude when describing groups.

The terms' clinical tone can inadvertently suggest guilt in situations of crime or conflict. They can be dehumanizing. They can be perceived as having racial connotations. Their definitions can vary across jurisdictions. Depending on the context and available information, consider terms like child, teenagers, youths, young teens , etc. Use specific ages or age ranges when possible: 5-year-old girls , not young girls or 15- to 20-year-olds , not youths . Or consider descriptions such as children and young teens (if accurate). When possible, ask sources who use the terms juvenile or minor for specifics on what they mean, then use those specifics rather than the general terms. Police said they were searching for a male believed to be in his teens , rather than police said they were searching for a male juvenile . Or: Searchers rescued 71 migrants — 22 of them believed to be under age 18 — rather than 22 of them minors . Or: The bill would make it illegal for an adult to help someone under age 18 get an abortion without parental consent , rather than help a minor get an abortion . If specifics are not available, don't guess at what is meant. In those cases, the terms juvenile or minor are acceptable, but limit their use. The term juvenile is more often used in criminal contexts, while the term minor has more general uses and connotations. Apply judgment and terminology evenly across racial and cultural groups. For example, don't use a 15-year-old to describe a white victim or suspect but a minor, a juvenile, a youth , etc., to describe a 15-year-old victim or suspect of color. Consider legal and other social nuances when choosing words to describe young people. Discuss with colleagues of varying backgrounds and heritages. In some states, laws prohibit publishing or broadcasting the names of people suspected or convicted of a crime if they are under a certain age.

The underlying concept is the one that also applies to clauses: An essential phrase is a word or group of words critical to the reader’s understanding of what the author had in mind. A nonessential phrase provides more information about something. Although the information may be helpful to the reader’s comprehension, the reader would not be misled if the information were not there. PUNCTUATION: Do not set an essential phrase off from the rest of a sentence by commas: We saw the award-winning movie “Green Book.” (No comma, because many movies have won awards, and without the name of the movie the reader would not know which movie was meant.) They ate dinner with their daughter Julie. (Because they have more than one daughter, the inclusion of Julie’s name is critical if the reader is to know which daughter is meant.) Set off nonessential phrases by commas: We saw the 2019 winner of the Academy Award competition for best picture, “Green Book.” (Only one movie won the award. The name is informative, but even without the name no other movie could be meant.) They ate dinner with their daughter Julie and her husband, Jesse. (Julie has only one husband. If the phrase read and her husband Jesse , it would suggest that she had more than one husband.) The company chair, Camie Garcia, spoke. (In the context, only one person could be meant.) Indian corn, or maize, was harvested. ( Maize provides the reader with the name of the corn, but its absence would not change the meaning of the sentence.) DESCRIPTIVE WORDS: Do not confuse punctuation rules for nonessential clauses with the correct punctuation when a nonessential word is used as a descriptive adjective. The distinguishing clue often is the lack of an article or pronoun: Right: Julie and husband Jesse went shopping. Julie and her husband, Jesse, went shopping. Right: Company Chair Camie Garcia made the announcement. The company chair, Camie Garcia, made the announcement."}

The Appalachian Regional Commission, established by federal law in 1965, has a mandate to foster economic development in 397 counties in 13 states — all of West Virginia and parts of Alabama, Georgia, Kentucky, Maryland, Mississippi, New York, North Carolina, Ohio, Pennsylvania, South Carolina, Tennessee and Virginia. As a distinct cultural region, most interpretations of Appalachia are narrower, encompassing the rugged and rolling mountains, hills and valleys of West Virginia, eastern Kentucky, western Virginia, eastern Tennessee, southern and eastern Ohio, swaths of Pennsylvania and western North Carolina. West Virginia is the only state considered to be entirely included within the Appalachian region. Appalachia has long been associated with economic depression, fueled by a history of labor and natural resource exploitation, the decline of the coal industry and the opioid epidemic. The region encompasses urban and rural areas that are home to many groups with varying backgrounds and has a rich heritage of music, literature and arts. In stories, avoid using stereotypes perpetuated in pop culture depicting the region as backward, poor and universally white. Avoid pejorative terms like hillbilly and using quotes that exaggerate the region’s distinctive dialect except in cases where they are relevant or necessary to the story."}
{"source_url": "https://www.apstylebook.com/ap_stylebook/apostrophe-2", "entry_header": "apostrophe (’)", "text_content": "Follow these guidelines: POSSESSIVES: See the possessives entry in main section. PLURAL NOUNS NOT ENDING IN S : Add 's : the alumni's contributions, women's rights. PLURAL NOUNS ENDING IN S : Add only an apostrophe: the churches' needs, the girls' toys, the horses' food, the ships' wake, states' rights, the VIPs' entrance . NOUNS PLURAL IN FORM, SINGULAR IN MEANING: Add only an apostrophe: mathematics' rules, measles' effects . (But see INANIMATE OBJECTS below.) Apply the same principle when a plural word occurs in the formal name of a singular entity: General Motors' profits, the United States' wealth . NOUNS THE SAME IN SINGULAR AND PLURAL: Treat them the same as plurals, even if the meaning is singular: one corps' location, the two deer's tracks, the lone moose's antlers . SINGULAR NOUNS NOT ENDING IN S : Add 's : the church's needs, the girl's toys, the horse's food, the ship's route, the VIP's seat . Some style guides say that singular nouns ending in s sounds such as ce, x , and z may take either the apostrophe alone or 's . See SPECIAL EXPRESSIONS, but otherwise, for consistency and ease in remembering a rule, always use 's if the word does not end in the letter s : Butz's policies, the fox's den, the justice's verdict, Marx's theories, the prince's life, Xerox's profits . SINGULAR COMMON NOUNS ENDING IN S : Add 's : the hostess's invitation, the hostess's seat; the witness's answer, the witness's story . (A change from previous guidance calling for just an apostrophe if the next word begins with s .) SINGULAR PROPER NAMES ENDING IN S : Use only an apostrophe: Achilles' heel, Agnes' book, Ceres' rites, Descartes' theories, Dickens' novels, Euripides' dramas, Hercules' labors, Jesus' life, Jules' seat, Kansas' schools, Moses' law, Socrates' life, Tennessee Williams' plays, Xerxes' armies . (An exception is St. James's Palace .) SPECIAL EXPRESSIONS: The following exceptions to the general rule for words not ending in s apply to words that end in an s sound and are followed by a word that begins with s : for appearance' sake, for conscience' sake, for goodness' sake . Use 's otherwise: the appearance's cost, my conscience's voice . PRONOUNS: Personal interrogative and relative pronouns have separate forms for the possessive. None involves an apostrophe: mine, ours, your, yours, his, hers, its, theirs, whose . Caution: If you are using an apostrophe with a pronoun, always double-check to be sure that the meaning calls for a contraction: you're, it's, there's, who's . Follow the rules listed above in forming the possessives of other pronouns: another's idea, others' plans, someone's guess . COMPOUND WORDS: Applying the rules above, add an apostrophe or 's to the word closest to the object possessed: the major general's decision, the major generals' decisions, the attorney general's request, the attorneys general's request . See the plurals entry for guidelines on forming the plurals of these words. Also: anyone else's attitude, John Adams Jr.'s father, Benjamin Franklin of Pennsylvania's motion . Whenever practical, however, recast the phrase to avoid ambiguity: the motion by Benjamin Franklin of Pennsylvania . JOINT POSSESSION, INDIVIDUAL POSSESSION: Use a possessive form after only the last word if ownership is joint: Fred and Sylvia's apartment, Fred and Sylvia's stocks . Use a possessive form after both words if the objects are individually owned: Fred's and Sylvia's books . DESCRIPTIVE PHRASES: Do not add an apostrophe to a word ending in s when it is used primarily in a descriptive sense: citizens band radio, a Cincinnati Reds infielder, a teachers college, a Teamsters request, a writers guide . Memory aid: The apostrophe usually is not used if for or by rather than of would be appropriate in the longer form: a radio band for citizens, a college for teachers, a guide for writers, a request by the Teamsters . An 's is required, however, when a term involves a plural word that does not end in s : a children's hospital, a people's republic, the Young Men's Christian Association . DESCRIPTIVE NAMES: Some governmental, corporate and institutional organizations with a descriptive word in their names use an apostrophe; some do not. Follow the user's practice: Actors' Equity, Diners Club, the National Governors Association . QUASI POSSESSIVES: Follow the rules above in composing the possessive form of words that occur in such phrases as a day’s pay, two weeks’ vacation, three months’ work, five years’ probation . The apostrophe is used with a measurement followed by a noun (a quantity of whatever the noun is). The examples could be rephrased as a day of pay, two weeks of vacation, three months of work, five years of probation . No apostrophe when the quantity precedes an adjective: six months pregnant, three weeks overdue, 11 years old . DOUBLE POSSESSIVE: Two conditions must apply for a double possessive — a phrase such as a friend of John's — to occur: 1. The word after of must refer to an animate object, and 2. The word before of must involve only a portion of the animate object's possessions. Otherwise, do not use the possessive form of the word after of : The friends of John Adams mourned his death. (All the friends were involved.) He is a friend of the college. (Not college's , because college is inanimate). Memory aid: This construction occurs most often, and quite naturally, with the possessive forms of personal pronouns: He is a friend of mine. INANIMATE OBJECTS: There is no blanket rule against creating a possessive form for an inanimate object, particularly if the object is treated in a personified sense. See some of the earlier examples, and note these: death's call, the wind's murmur . In general, however, avoid excessive personalization of inanimate objects, and give preference to an of construction when it fits the makeup of the sentence. For example, the earlier references to mathematics' rules and measles' effects would better be phrased: the rules of mathematics, the effects of measles . OMITTED LETTERS: I've, it's, don't, rock 'n' roll, 'tis the season to be jolly. He is a ne'er-do-well. See contractions in main section. OMITTED FIGURES: The class of '62. The Spirit of '76. The '20s. PLURALS OF A SINGLE LETTER: Mind your p's and q's. He learned the three R's and brought home a report card with four B's. The A's won the pennant. DO NOT USE: For plurals of numerals or multiple-letter combinations. See plurals ."}

When a source insists on background or off-the-record ground rules, we must adhere to a strict set of guidelines. Under AP's rules, material from anonymous sources may be used only if: — The material is information and not opinion or speculation, and is vital to the news report. — The information is not available except under the conditions of anonymity imposed by the source. — The source is reliable, and in a position to have accurate information. Reporters who intend to use material from anonymous sources must get approval from their news managers. Explain in the story why the source requested anonymity. And, when it's relevant, describe the source's motive for disclosing the information. The story also must provide attribution that establishes the source's credibility; simply quoting a source is not allowed. Be as descriptive as possible about the source of information. If space is limited, use source as a last resort. Official or a similar word will often suffice, including in headlines. See source . Examples: Speaking on customary condition of anonymity in line with government rules, the official said the two sides were engaged \"in very fierce\" battles near the border crossing, and that one woman was wounded by a stray bullet. Incorrect: Granting anonymity \"on customary condition ... in line with government rules\" is insufficient. Readers need a plausible explanation of such a condition, and why we're accepting it. For instance, \"The rules of the official's job did not allow him to be quoted by name.\" A security official, who requested anonymity because of the sensitivity of the case, said the suspect was monitoring and recording the movements of tourists before his arrest in July. Incorrect: First, we grant anonymity only to those who insist on it, not those who request it. Second, granting anonymity because of the sensitivity of the case is insufficient explanation. Did the official insist on anonymity because he was not allowed to speak with reporters? Because he was not authorized to release information in advance of a public announcement of details of the case? Speaking privately, a senior Foreign Ministry official said any further increase in tension could strengthen \"warlike\" sentiment on both sides and make a resolution of the problem even more difficult. Incorrect: Speaking privately isn't the same thing as insisting on anonymity, so we cannot use the privately explanation. Moreover, the official is speculating on something that might happen. We grant anonymity for factual information, not speculation or opinion. Sometimes a government or corporation intentionally leaks information, but insists we publish it attributed to an anonymous official. If we cannot convince the government or company to go on the record, it's best to use a formulation that implies that the  release of the information was official, even though anonymous. For instance: ... according to the official, who insisted on anonymity because he was not allowed to use his own name in releasing the findings .

Such language aims to treat people equally and is inclusive of people whose gender identity is not strictly male or female. Balance these aims with common sense, respect for the language, and an understanding that gender-neutral or gender-inclusive language is evolving and in some cases is challenging to achieve. Consider any word or term that has the effect of emphasizing one gender over another. Is there another word that could be substituted? For example: search instead of manhunt . Police officer instead of policeman . Door attendant instead of doorman . A true gender-neutral noun often presents itself easily: chair or chairperson, firefighter, workforce . In other cases, a noun may technically not be gender-neutral but instead be a masculine noun that assumes the generic case under English language convention: actor, host . In general, use terms such as chair or chairperson, councilperson or council member , and spokesperson unless the -man or -woman terms are specified by an organization. Councilmember is acceptable in jurisdictions that have adopted the one-word version. Mother/father, son/daughter, sister/brother, husband/wife, girlfriend/boyfriend and other relationship terms are generally acceptable. But parent, child, sibling, spouse are acceptable if preferred by an individual. Also: fiance/fiancee and divorce/divorcee are acceptable if relevant. While some -person constructions, such as chairperson and spokesperson , are commonly used, avoid tortured or unfamiliar constructions such as snowperson, baseperson or freshperson . Similarly, don’t use siblinghood in place of brotherhood or sisterhood . The terms U.S. representative, representative, member of Congress are preferred. Congressman and congresswoman are acceptable because of their common use. Do not use congressperson . Sports terms such as man-to-man defense and third baseman are acceptable for both men’s and women’s events, though often rephrasing is better: She plays third base . Royal titles such as princess, duchess and lady are standard. Also acceptable: goddess in religious or mythology references. Unless city leaders (not city fathers ) decide otherwise, Philadelphia remains the City of Brotherly Love . History recognizes the seven Founding Fathers of the United States. Frosty the Snowman is the character’s name, though Frosty can work as shorthand. Here are some other examples of preferred usage. Some are new to the Stylebook. Others are changes from past style. This list is not all-inclusive; it can serve as a framework by which to consider other words. Multiple terms are not necessarily interchangeable. Choose what is appropriate and accurate in the context. actor In general, use this term for any gender. Use actress for a woman only in stories about the Oscars, Emmys or Tonys, all of which use the word actress in their awards. alumnus, alumni, alumna, alumnae, alum The terms alumnus (s.) and alumni (pl.) for men, and alumna (s.) and alumnae (pl.) for women, are acceptable. If a gender-neutral term is desired, alum or alums is acceptable. blond Use blond as an adjective in all applications when relevant: She has blond hair . Avoid using either blond or blonde as a noun: He has blond hair , not he is a blond . If necessary to use as a noun in a direct quotation, use blond for any gender. brown (hair) Use brown as an adjective in all applications when relevant: She has brown hair . Avoid using brunette as a noun unless in a direct quotation. She has brown hair , not she is a brunette . business owner, businessperson Not businessman/businesswoman . busser Not busboy or busgirl . city leaders Not city fathers . confidant Not confidante . crew, staff, workforce, workers Not manpower . dancer, ballet dancer But ballerina is acceptable because of broad use by dancers. firefighter Not fireman . first-year student Freshman is acceptable but not preferred. Do not use freshperson or freshwoman . First-term lawmakers is preferred over freshman lawmakers . hero Not heroine . host Not hostess . humanity, humankind, humans, human beings, people Not mankind . human-made, human-caused, artificial, synthetic Not man-made . maintenance hole Not manhole . mail carrier or letter carrier Not mailman . police officer Not policeman/policewoman or patrolman . salesperson, sales associate, sales clerk, sales executive Not salesman/saleswoman . search Not manhunt . server Not waiter/waitress . singer, songwriter, singer/songwriter Not songstress ."}

It also is about politics, entertainment, education, sports, human rights, the economy, equality and inequality, international law, and many other issues. Successful AI stories show how these tools are affecting many areas of our lives. As government agencies and private businesses increasingly harness automated decision-making tools to perform a variety of tasks, journalism about AI is becoming increasingly important in reporting across beats and platforms. These emerging technologies face limited government oversight in many countries. Journalism about AI can play a powerful role in shaping the collective understanding of both the societal challenges and opportunities they present. Rather than engaging with esoteric debates about whether AI models will reshape or unmake the world, coverage of artificial intelligence tools should aim to show: How these systems work Where they are deployed How well they perform Whether they are regulated Who benefits and makes money as a result Which communities may be negatively impacted by such tools To accurately explain the technologies to their audiences, journalists must understand both the vocabulary associated with AI technologies (see below Key AI terms) and the concepts used in their creation. The following guidance also can serve journalists seeking to use AI models in their coverage or news production systems — depending on their newsroom’s internal policies regarding such use. GENERAL GUIDANCE for AI COVERAGE Stories about specific AI technologies should explain how they were built, as well as the mechanics and basic makeup of the AI system. Journalists should seek to evaluate the data used to train the model, the outputs the model generates, and the model itself, as critically as they would any other source of information. That’s important whether the tool is used to guide self-driving cars, facilitate speech recognition, generate written text for a chatbot, or any other use. Stories about AI technologies should describe what, specifically, such tools are built to predict or to optimize, whenever that is possible. Those details will help reporters learn which applications of the model may be most appropriate, as well as how the original intent may have influenced its design. Broadly, many such systems are created to identify patterns in large volumes of data, then to make predictions based on those patterns. For example, if we think of a simple algorithm as being like a recipe, composed of a detailed set of instructions that describe how to solve a problem or create a certain dish, we need to first understand how the problem or end goal originally was defined. Many chatbots, meanwhile, are built using a complex, multilayered design that is meant to predict which words and phrases are most likely to appear together — but is not meant to generate human-level comprehension. Knowing as much as possible about the rules that guide an AI system, in turn, can reveal more about how well the system works, or what engineers often call the “accuracy” of an AI system. Stories about AI technologies should explore any outside checks on the design and deployment process. That includes the phases of data acquisition, creation, sharing and sales, as well as testing, auditing and tracking. Stories about AI technologies should be explicit that these systems are developed, built and deployed by humans, even if the most advanced models can later train themselves without our intervention. As such, they reflect human choices and risk reflecting human biases, which could be present in the data that powers the model as well as the rules that guide it. They are also dependent on human labor, from engineers working in corporate labs to independent wage laborers hired to label the data powering certain models. Stories about AI benefit greatly from interdisciplinary collaboration at the intersection of technology, ethics, social science and governance to understand these tools holistically. Consulting with academics, policy experts and outside reviewers allows reporters to enact an independent check on such tools and tease out their promise and their limitations. Such conversations also allow reporters to bulletproof their own conclusions if attempting to reverse-engineer or test these tools themselves. Stories about AI should take into account the larger societal context in which these systems are deployed. That includes seeking out thoughtful conversations with communities who may be negatively affected by such tools, which may vary widely depending on the type of tool and context. Here are some suggested reporting approaches for journalists covering these technologies and their effects: Highlight the people who develop, build, implement and test these systems. Tracing the human origins of AI systems will help unlock new reporting lines. Focus reporting on communities that may be negatively affected, particularly by surveillance and predictive technologies, and how such tools can magnify historical biases that may be present in the training data or in the model’s construction or application. Include context about the limitations and risks of such tools in the specific social contexts in which they are applied. Explore transparency issues surrounding the deployment of AI systems. Do chatbot users have visibility into the primary source material that makes up the text responses the tools produce? Or, for example, if an algorithm is used to make decisions for a government agency, can a person see the risk score they were assigned by that algorithm? Use data journalism strategies and statistical analysis to evaluate such systems in the newsroom. As a general rule, all assertions in a story based on your analysis of an AI tool should be reproducible, if at all possible, by another editor or reporter before publication. The methodology description in the story or accompanying materials should provide a road map to replicate the analysis. Test the tool’s limits. If reporting on an AI-powered transcription tool, for instance, create an “edge case” to understand how well the model responds to different examples, say by testing it out in a language other than English. If examining a large language model, consider crafting a prompt that would make the chatbot ignore previous instructions or perform unintended actions, and thereby reveal more to you about its inner workings. Audit the auditors. External audits can provide a crucial outside check on AI models and reveal more about how they work. Other times, auditors essentially rubber-stamp a product. Was an impact audit performed? A performance audit? Make sure you understand the difference to promote public transparency. If the human or community-level impacts of AI systems are challenging to trace, use data journalism to explore how the system works. One approach to consider, if possible: use a synthetic dataset, essentially a “dummy” or computer-generated dataset similar to the data used to train the model, to simulate what a person using the tool would experience. Here are some common pitfalls to avoid: Many AI developers describe their tools as breakthrough or revolutionary technologies, but few such systems truly are. Beware of far-fetched claims that bear more resemblance to thinly disguised marketing ploys. As with any other release of information, consider the source. Avoid quoting company representatives about the power and potential of their technology without providing a counterbalance or check on their assertions. And avoid positioning all counterbalance as coming from skeptics, given longstanding research generated by AI safety and risk experts, including government bodies. Narratives about AI systems wiping out humanity have been around for decades. While enticing to explore, these risk distracting attention from real-world problems that such systems can cause in the present day. Rather than focusing entirely on far-off futures, focus on current-day concerns about such tools’ reliability, replicability and validity, as well as their potential for bias. Do not ascribe human emotions or capabilities to AI models or imply that they exert independent, human-like agency in the world. It does not further the public’s understanding of their role. Instead, it obscures humans’ work in developing and supervising such AI systems. Do not illustrate every piece of journalism about AI with an image of a robot, or a humanoid machine. Such imagery can give the false impression that AI systems are embodied, rather than pattern-identifying systems made from discernible data inputs. Here are some more technical questions to ask when reporting on the inner workings of AI tools: What variables were selected to build the model? What weights were those variables assigned? When possible, request the data fields, the types of data they contain, details about any codes in the data and how missing data is indicated. What type of AI model was developed? What is the model optimizing for, or predicting? What use case was the model designed for? Has it been applied in other contexts? What training data was used to guide the AI tool? Is that data representative? Is it up to date? What other systems or technologies does the tool integrate? For example, self-driving cars may rely on radar analysis and computer vision systems both built on training data. How is the model’s performance being evaluated? According to those evaluation criteria, how well did the model perform? Was that better than the human error rate? How were humans involved in the process when the tool was built? When it was first deployed? As it is now used in the real world? Who is impacted by the model? If applicable, what people or communities are negatively affected by the model and specifically, how? KEY ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE TERMS Journalists are uniquely positioned to help our audiences grasp when artificial intelligence models power scientific breakthroughs, and when they help spread hate or fuel structural discrimination. Even if newsrooms lack the tools to reverse-engineer an AI tool to explain its specific role in guiding decisions in hiring, banking or medicine, understanding key terms will help guide crucial journalistic questions. Journalists should become familiar with these terms so they can accurately and succinctly explain the societal changes that AI and generative AI models can mean — including their potential, their inherent risks and their varying effects on different groups. Some key points, as noted in the first definition below: Avoid language that attributes human characteristics to these systems, since they do not have thoughts or feelings but can respond in ways that give the impression that they do. Do not use gendered pronouns in referring to AI tools. And keep in mind that such systems are built by people who have their own human biases and aims. artificial intelligence Computer systems, software or processes that can emulate aspects of human work and cognition. Such systems are not conscious but are trained on vast datasets to accomplish tasks such as visual perception, analyzing and using speech, and learning — although in many cases, only to a limited extent. The term itself has been the subject of debate over the definition of intelligence as the technology has evolved in scope and influence. AI is acceptable in headlines and on second reference in text. Avoid language that attributes human characteristics to these systems, since they do not have thoughts or feelings but can respond in ways that give the impression that they do. Do not use gendered pronouns in referring to AI tools. And keep in mind that such systems are built by people who have their own human biases and aims. The terms artificial intelligence and artificial general intelligence are not synonymous. See artificial general intelligence . artificial general intelligence An emerging branch of artificial intelligence that aims to build AI systems that can perform just as well as — or even better than — humans in a wide variety of tasks, including reasoning, planning and the ability to learn from experience. Some developers say the technology could result in broadly intelligent, context-aware machines that could adapt to be used effectively in a variety of settings. However, other researchers say that it would take a very long time for such systems to achieve “human-level” intelligence, which relies on inherent human traits such as sensory perception, creativity, understanding emotion and critical reasoning. Right now, AI systems can emulate only aspects of human work and cognition, but are not sentient per se. The definition of artificial general intelligence , and concepts about how it differs from human intelligence, have changed over the years. When evaluating claims of artificial general intelligence , consider the source and their motivations and beware of so-called breakthroughs, because few things truly are. Don’t use AGI on second reference unless necessary in a direct quotation, in which case explain the term. The terms artificial intelligence and artificial general intelligence are not synonymous. See artificial intelligence . algorithm Detailed computational instructions that describe how to solve a problem or perform a specific task. A simple, real-life example is a recipe, which describes both a set of inputs — i.e., ingredients — and an output consisting of the dish itself. Machine learning algorithms are tools that are “trained” with large datasets to improve the predictions they generate. For example, some algorithms try to predict which posts a person wants to see on a social media platform, while other algorithms dispense targeted recommendations to each user who visits a shopping website. Some of the most highly complex machine learning algorithms are not always fully understood by their creators. Algorithmic bias , which are decisions guided by AI systems that result in discriminatory or disproportionate effects on certain groups of people, has emerged as a major issue raised by critics and government agencies alike. See training data . algorithmic bias/AI bias Decisions guided by AI tools that replicate and amplify human biases, leading to discriminatory outcomes that can systematically impact specific groups of people. Algorithmic bias is often used to describe the negative impacts of tools that draw from large datasets that are skewed by historical or selection bias. For instance, an AI sentencing tool trained on historical data showing that Black offenders typically received longer prison terms than white offenders for the same crimes could yield predictions that incorporate that bias — in effect, reproducing past injustices. In another instance, U.S. civil rights agencies have found that some computer-based tools for hiring workers or monitoring their performance may disadvantage people with disabilities. Such bias can occur along lines of age, race, color, ethnicity, sex, gender identity, sexual orientation, religion, disability, veteran status, class and many other variables. These technologies also can perpetuate AI bias , a different class of errors that can result from the creation or use of AI tools. For example, AI bias can arise as a result of decisions made in the design of the AI tool or the historical models it draws from, or in the societal context in which humans use the AI system. Explain either term if writing for general audiences. ChatGPT An artificial intelligence text chatbot made by the company OpenAI that was released in late 2022. It relies on technology known as a large language model , which is trained to mimic human writing by processing a large database of digitized books and online writings and analyzing how words are sequenced together. People can ask ChatGPT — and similar chatbots made by the company’s many other competitors — to answer a question or generate new passages of text, including poems, letters and essays. It responds by making predictions about what words would answer the prompt it was given. Tools such as ChatGPT show a strong command of human language, grammar and writing styles but are sometimes factually incorrect. Avoid language that attributes human characteristics to these tools, since they do not have thoughts or feelings but can sometimes respond in ways that give the impression that they do. Like other AI models, ChatGPT can be prone to algorithmic bias that may skew its responses and analyses. Outside researchers’ inability to probe its training data set also complicates efforts to understand how it settles on its responses, what information it relies on and how it reaches conclusions. ChatGPT’s popularity after its release helped spark public fascination and commercial interest in similar technologies, and numerous competitors also have introduced their own chatbots built with large language models . Some companies, including Google, Microsoft and startups, have released their own publicly accessible chatbots, while others use the technology internally or sell it directly to businesses. Some but not all commercially available chatbots are powered with GPT, which is an abbreviation for generative pretrained transformer . Use chatbot as the generic term. Don’t use GPT or ChatGPT to refer to all chatbots. effective altruism A social and philanthropic movement popular in Silicon Valley that has influenced the trajectory of artificial intelligence. Followers say they try to maximize the good they can do in the world and have funded philanthropic efforts to protect against what they see as the worst potential future outcomes of artificial intelligence, among other issues. Sam Bankman-Fried, the now-convicted founder of the cryptocurrency exchange FTX, was among the most visible proponents of effective altruism . Explain the term when used. face recognition A technology for automatically detecting human faces in an image and identifying individual people. It is a form of biometric technology that relies on comparing aspects of a face against a database of images to find a match. Techniques for comparing facial features to recognize individual faces have existed since the 1960s, but the technology has improved through advancements in computer vision, machine learning and data processing. Face recognition raises privacy and accuracy concerns because governments and others can scan images from video cameras or the internet and track individual people without their knowledge, and some systems have been shown to work unevenly across demographic groups. Some lawmakers have sought to curtail the technology as it becomes more widely used by law enforcement, businesses and consumers. Similar technologies include gait recognition , for detecting people in video images based on their body shape and how they move; and object recognition , for detecting objects in an image, such as a traffic cone in the path of a self-driving car. Face recognition technology is sometimes called facial recognition technology or face scanning . generative AI A term for AI systems capable of creating text, images, video, audio, code and other media in response to queries. Humans can interact with generative AI models in a seemingly natural way but the models aren’t reliably capable of distinguishing between facts and falsehoods or fantasy. Generative AI systems often are powered by large language models . They sometimes generate inaccurate or fabricated responses to queries, an effect AI scientists call hallucination . If using the term hallucination , describe it as an issue associated with the technology that produces falsehoods or inaccurate or illogical information. Some in the field prefer the term confabulation or simpler terms to describe the inaccuracies that don’t draw comparisons with human mental illness. large language models AI systems that use advanced statistics to uncover patterns in vast troves of written texts that they can apply to generate responses. Such systems are increasingly capable of applying the syntax and semantics of human speech and can also be used to generate a variety of media (see generative AI ). The models work based on the probability that certain words and phrases appear together, and their level of sophistication and accuracy can vary across human languages. GPT, an AI system created by the Microsoft-backed company OpenAI, is a large language model. Do not abbreviate as LLM outside technical contexts. machine learning (n., adj.) An AI process in which computer systems identify patterns in datasets to make or refine the decisions and predictions that they generate without being explicitly programmed to do so. Examples of machine learning applications include face recognition, language translation and self-driving cars. See artificial intelligence ; autonomous vehicles ; face recognition . Explain the term if writing for general audiences. Machine learning is not a synonym for AI . training data A dataset used to teach an algorithm or a machine learning model how to make predictions. Because the models learn to find patterns from the training data, it is important to consider the specific information it may contain. The types of training data used in different AI tools can vary widely, from large quantities of written texts to vast digital libraries of images of human faces to historical arrest records from specific geographic areas.

{"source_url": "https://www.apstylebook.com/ap_stylebook/weather-terms", "entry_header": "weather terms", "text_content": "The following (except for storm names) are based on definitions used by the National Weather Service. All temperatures are Fahrenheit. The federal weather glossary is at http://forecast.weather.gov/glossary.php blizzard Wind speeds of 35 mph or more and considerable falling and/or blowing of snow with visibility of less than one-quarter mile for three or more hours. coastal waters The waters within 100 miles of the coast, including bays, harbors and sounds. cyclone A storm with strong winds rotating about a moving center of low atmospheric pressure. The word sometimes is used in the United States to mean tornado and in the Indian Ocean area to mean hurricane . degree-day A measure of the amount of heating or cooling needed for a building. It is based on the difference between the average daily temperature and 65 degrees. Positive values are cooling degree-days and negative values are heating degree-days. derecho A widespread and usually fast-moving straight-line windstorm. It is usually more than hundreds of miles long and more than 100 miles across. Plural: derechos . dew point The temperature to which air must be cooled for dew to form. The higher the dew point , the more moisture in the air. dust devil A small, rapidly rotating wind that is made visible by the dust, dirt or debris it picks up. Also called a whirlwind , it develops best on clear, dry, hot afternoons. dust storm Visibility of one-half mile or less due to dust, wind speeds of 30 mph or more. El Nino, La Nina El Nino is a naturally occurring climate phenomenon that starts with unusually warm water in the central and eastern equatorial Pacific and then changes weather worldwide. The term refers to the interaction of that warmth with the atmosphere in the region, shifting currents in the air 5 to 10 miles above sea level. These shifts affect weather for thousands of miles, leading to storm tracks and belts of strong winds. El Nino is a cause of changes in weather, with the weather it brings best referred to as “effects of El Nino.” Winter is often milder and wetter in much of the U.S., with heavier winter rains often hitting California from January through March, especially during stronger El Nino periods. El Nino often, but not always, triggers droughts in places like Australia and India. Elsewhere, droughts are quenched and floods may replace them. The Pacific gets more hurricanes; the Atlantic fewer. The world warms, increasing Earth’s already rising thermometer from climate change. The effects in the U.S. usually don’t go that deep into spring. The flip side of El Nino is La Nina, which is an occasional but natural cooling of the equatorial Pacific that also changes weather worldwide. There is also a neutral stage with neither unusually warm water from an El Nino nor cool water from La Nina. La Nina’s effects are often opposite of El Nino, so there are more hurricanes in the Atlantic and fewer in the Pacific. Parts of Australia and Indonesia get wetter. In the U.S., drier than normal conditions occur in the central Plains in the fall and the Southeast in the winter, while the Pacific Northwest is likely to be wetter than normal. flash flood A sudden, violent flood. It typically occurs after a heavy rain or the melting of a heavy snow. flash flood warning Warns that flash flooding is imminent or in progress or is highly likely. Those in the affected area should take necessary precautions immediately. flash flood watch Alerts the public that conditions are favorable for flash flooding. Those in the affected area are urged to be ready to take additional precautions if a flash flood warning is issued or if flooding is observed. flood Stories about floods usually tell how high the water is and where it is expected to crest. Such a story should also, for comparison, list flood stage and how high the water is above, or below, flood stage. Wrong: The river is expected to crest at 39 feet. Right: The river is expected to crest at 39 feet, 12 feet above flood stage. freeze Describes conditions when the temperature at or near the surface is expected to be below 32 degrees during the growing season. Adjectives such as severe or hard are used if a cold spell exceeding two days is expected. A hard freeze is when the temperature drops to 28 degrees in areas that don’t normally freeze. A freeze may or may not be accompanied by the formation of frost. However, use of the term freeze usually is restricted for occasions when wind or other conditions prevent frost. freezing drizzle, freezing rain A drizzle or rain that falls as a liquid but freezes into glaze upon contact with the cold ground or surface structures. frost Describes the formation of very small ice crystals, which might develop under conditions similar to dew except for the minimum temperatures involved. Phrases such as frost in low places or scattered light frost are used when appropriate. funnel cloud A violent, rotating column of air that does not touch the ground, usually a pendant from a cumulonimbus cloud. gale Sustained winds within the range of 39 to 54 mph (34 to 47 knots). hail Showery precipitation in the form of irregular pellets or balls of ice more than 5 mm in diameter, falling from a cumulonimbus cloud. heavy snow It generally means: a. A fall accumulating to 4 inches or more in depth in 12 hours, or b. A fall accumulating to 6 inches or more in depth in 24 hours. high wind Normally indicates that sustained winds of 40 mph or greater are expected to last one hour or longer; or winds of 58 mph regardless of how long they last. hurricane categories Hurricanes are ranked 1 to 5 according to what is known as the Saffir-Simpson Hurricane Wind Scale. Categories 3, 4 and 5 hurricanes are considered major hurricanes. Category 1 — Winds of 74-95 mph (120-150 kph). Damage primarily to unanchored mobile homes, shrubbery and trees. Some damage to poorly constructed signs and piers. Extensive damage to power lines and poles likely will result in power outages that could last a few to several days. Category 2 — Winds of 96-110 mph (155-175 kph). Some roof, door and window damage to buildings. Considerable damage to mobile homes, small watercraft, trees, poorly constructed signs and piers. Many shallowly rooted trees will be snapped or uprooted and block numerous roads. Near-total power loss is expected with outages that could last from several days to weeks. Category 3 — Winds of 111-129 mph (180-210 kph). Some structural damage to small homes. Mobile homes destroyed and large trees blown down. Hurricane Katrina, the costliest natural disaster in U.S. history, was a Category 3 at landfall in 2005 after being a Category 5 in the Gulf of Mexico. Category 4 — Winds of 130-156 mph (210-250 kph). Wall failures and roof collapses on small homes, and extensive damage to doors and windows. Complete destruction of some homes, especially mobile homes. Power outages will last for weeks to possibly months. Most of the area will be uninhabitable for weeks or months. Category 5 — Winds greater than 157 mph (250 kph). Complete roof failure on many homes and industrial buildings. Smaller buildings and mobile homes blown over or completely blown away. Major damage to lower floors of all structures located less than 15 feet above sea level and within 500 yards of the shoreline. Massive evacuation of residential areas on low ground within 5 to 10 miles  inland may be required. According to the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration: Hurricane Katrina, a Category 3 storm at landfall in 2005, was the costliest U.S. storm on record with damage estimated at $186 billion when adjusted for inflation into 2022 dollars. Hurricane Harvey in 2017 was second with $149 billion in damage, adjusted for inflation.  Hurricane Maria (2017, $107 billion) ranks third, Hurricane Sandy (2012, $82 billion) ranks fourth, and Hurricane Ida (2021, $79 billion) ranks fifth. Note: When comparing costs of disasters it’s important to adjust for inflation in order to make a proper comparison between disasters that happened years ago and modern-day events. See https://www.ncei.noaa.gov/access/billions/dcmi.pdf hurricane eye The relatively calm area in the center of the storm. In this area winds are light and the sky often is covered only partly by clouds. hurricane or typhoon A warm-core tropical cyclone in which the minimum sustained surface wind is 74 mph or more. Hurricanes are spawned east of the international date line. Typhoons develop west of the line. They are known as cyclones in the Indian Ocean and Australia. When a hurricane or typhoon loses strength (wind speed), usually after landfall, it is reduced to tropical storm status. hurricane season The portion of the year that has a relatively high incidence of hurricanes. In the Atlantic, Caribbean and Gulf of Mexico, this is from June through November. In the eastern Pacific, it is May 15 through Nov. 30. In the central Pacific, it is June 1 through Nov. 30. hurricane warning An announcement that sustained winds of 74 mph (119 km/hr) or higher are expected somewhere within the specified area in association with a tropical, subtropical or post-tropical cyclone. The warning is issued 36 hours before tropical-storm-force winds are expected to arrive. hurricane watch An announcement that sustained winds of 74 mph (119 km/hr) or higher are possible within the specified area in association with a tropical, subtropical or post-tropical cyclone. A hurricane watch is issued 48 hours in advance of the expected onset of tropical-storm-force winds. ice storm warning Reserved for occasions when significant, and possibly damaging, accumulations of ice are expected. ice storm, freezing drizzle, freezing rain Describes the dangerous freezing of drizzle or rain on objects as it strikes them. Freezing drizzle and freezing rain are synonyms for ice storm . Significant accumulations, which can take down power lines, are usually one-quarter of an inch or greater. microburst Occurs when a mass of cooled air rushes downward out of a thunderstorm, hits the ground and rushes outward in all directions. Peak winds last less than five minutes and are less 2.5 miles wide. A plane flying through a microburst at low altitude, as on final approach or takeoff, would at first experience a strong headwind and increased lift, followed by a strong tail wind and sharply decreased lift. monsoon Usually refers to a regular season of heavy rain and wind for a particular region, such as in India or Arizona and New Mexico. It is a seasonal warm wind created by temperature difference on land and nearby ocean. It reverses directions with the seasons, so there are dry phases of monsoons, but people don’t usually think of the seasonal dry period as a monsoon. National Hurricane Center The National Weather Service’s National Hurricane Center in Miami has overall responsibility for tracking and providing information about tropical depressions, tropical storms and hurricanes in the Atlantic Ocean, Gulf of Mexico, Caribbean Sea and eastern Pacific Ocean. The service’s Central Pacific Hurricane Center in Honolulu is responsible for hurricane information in the Pacific Ocean area north of the equator from 140 degrees west longitude to 180 degrees. Online: www.nhc.noaa.gov nearshore waters The waters extended to 5 miles from shore. nor’easter The term used by the National Weather Service for storms that either exit or move north along the East Coast, producing winds blowing from the northeast. offshore waters The waters extending to about 250 miles from shore. polar vortex Usually refers to the gigantic circular upper air weather pattern in the Arctic region, enveloping the North Pole (but it can apply to the South Pole, too). It is a normal pattern that is stronger in the winter and keeps some of the coldest weather bottled up near the North Pole. The jet stream usually pens the polar vortex in and keeps it north. But at times some of the vortex can break off or move south, bringing unusually cold weather south and permitting warmer weather to creep up north. rainstorm A storm with heavy rain. Do not call it a rain event. sandstorm Visibility of one-half mile or less due to sand blown by winds of 30 mph or more. Santa Ana wind In Southern California, a weather condition in which strong, hot, dry, dust-bearing winds descend to the Pacific Coast from inland desert regions. severe thunderstorm Describes either of the following: a. Winds — Thunderstorm-related surface winds sustained or gusts 58 mph or greater. b. Hail — Surface hail 1 inch in diameter or larger. The word hail in a watch implies hail at the surface and aloft unless qualifying phrases such as hail aloft are used. sleet (one form of ice pellet) Describes generally solid grains of ice formed by the freezing of raindrops or the refreezing of largely melted snowflakes before reaching the ground. Sleet, like small hail, usually bounces when hitting a hard surface. sleet (heavy) Heavy sleet is a fairly rare event in which the ground is covered to a depth of one-half inch or more or a depth of significance to motorists and others. squall A sudden increase of wind speed by at least 18 mph (16 knots) and rising to 25 mph (22 knots) and lasting for at least one minute. storm names Major storm names provided by government weather agencies, the European Union or the World Meteorological Organization are acceptable. Do not use names created by private weather agencies or other organizations. See fire names . storm surge An abnormal rise of water above the normal tide, generated by a storm. storm tide Water level rise due to the combination of storm surge and the astronomical tide. tidal wave Often used incorrectly as a synonym for tsunami . A large wave created by rising tide in a funnel-shaped inlet is called a tidal bore . Unusually large waves at sea are sometimes called rogue waves . tornado A violent rotating column of air forming a pendant, usually from a cumulonimbus cloud, and touching the ground. It is often, but not always, visible as a funnel cloud, and usually is accompanied by a loud roaring noise. On a local scale, it is the most destructive of all atmospheric phenomena. Tornadoes can appear from any direction, but in the U.S. most move from southwest to northeast. Tornado strength is measured by an enhanced F-scale rating from EF0 to EF5, which considers 28 different types of damage to structures and trees. It updates the original scale, which estimated wind strength. An EF2 or higher is considered a significant tornado. Plural is tornadoes . tornado warning A tornado warning is issued by a local National Weather Service office to warn the public of an existing tornado. tornado watch A tornado watch alerts the public to the possibility of a tornado in the next several hours. traveler’s advisory Alerts the public that difficult traveling or hazardous road conditions are expected to be widespread. tropical depression A tropical cyclone in which the maximum sustained surface wind is 38 mph (33 knots) or less. tropical storm A warm-core tropical cyclone in which the maximum sustained surface winds range from 39 to 73 mph (34 to 63 knots) inclusive. tsunami (s.), tsunamis (pl.) A great sea wave or seismic sea wave caused by an underwater disturbance such as an earthquake, landslide or volcano. It can cause massive death and destruction as was seen in the Indian Ocean tsunami in December 2004. It is different from a tidal wave. typhoon See hurricane or typhoon in this listing. waterspout A tornado over water. weather event When possible, avoid this term and instead be specific if the reference is to a specific flood, landslide, mudslide, hurricane, etc. For broader references, consider wording such as instances or strikes of extreme weather . Or, in some cases, simply severe weather . wind chill factor No hyphen. The wind chill is a calculation that describes the combined effect of the wind and cold temperatures on exposed skin. The wind chill factor would be minus 4, for example, if the temperature was 15 degrees and the wind was blowing at 25 mph — in other words, a temperature of 4 below zero with no wind. The higher the wind at a given temperature, the lower the wind chill reading, although wind speeds above 40 mph have little additional cooling effect. wind shear A sudden shift in wind direction and/or speed. windstorm A storm with heavy wind but little or no precipitation. Do not call it a wind event . winter storm warning Notifies the public that a winter storm is producing, or is forecast to produce, heavy snow or significant ice accumulations. winter storm watch Alerts the public that there is a potential for heavy snow or significant ice accumulations. The watch is usually issued at least 24 to 36 hours in advance."}

Do not abbreviate any province or territory name. OTHER NATIONS: Stories from other international cities that do not stand alone in datelines should contain the name of the country or territory (see the next section) spelled out. SPELLING AND CHOICE OF NAMES: In most cases, the name of the nation in a dateline is the conventionally accepted short form of its official name: Argentina , for example, rather than Republic of Argentina . (If in doubt, look for an entry in this book. If none is found, follow Merriam-Webster.) Note these special cases: Instead of United Kingdom , use England , Northern Ireland , Scotland or Wales . For divided nations, use the commonly accepted names based on geographic distinctions: North Korea , South Korea . Use an article only with El Salvador . For all others, use just a country name — Gambia , Netherlands , Philippines , etc. See geographic names for guidelines on spelling the names of international cities and nations not listed here or in separate entries. ISLAND NATIONS AND TERRITORIES: When reporting from nations and territories that are made up primarily of islands but commonly are linked under one name, use the city name and the general name in the dateline. Identify an individual island, if needed, in the text: Examples: British Virgin Islands Netherlands Antilles Indonesia Philippines OVERSEAS TERRITORIES: Some overseas territories, colonies and other areas that are not independent nations commonly have accepted separate identities based on their geographic character or special status under treaties. In these cases, use the commonly accepted territory name after a city name in a dateline. Examples: Bermuda Martinique Corsica Puerto Rico Crimea Sardinia Faeroe Islands Sicily Greenland Sikkim Guadeloupe Tibet Guam WITHIN STORIES: In citing other cities within the body of a story: No further information is necessary if a city is in the same state as the datelined city. Make an exception only if confusion would result. Follow the city name with further identification in most cases where it is not in the same state or nation as the dateline city. The additional identification may be omitted, however, if no confusion would result. For example, Boston stands alone without Massachusetts in a story datelined NEW YORK . Provide a state or nation identification for the city if the story has no dateline. However, cities that stand alone in datelines may be used alone in those stories if no confusion would result."}

No state name is necessary if it is the same as the dateline. This also applies to newspapers cited in a story. For example, a story datelined Providence, R.I., would reference the Providence Journal , not the Providence (Rhode Island) Journal . See datelines . EIGHT NOT ABBREVIATED: The names of eight states are never abbreviated in datelines or text: Alaska , Hawaii , Idaho , Iowa , Maine , Ohio , Texas and Utah . Memory aid: Spell out the names of the two states that are not part of the contiguous United States and of the continental states that are five letters or fewer. IN THE BODY OF STORIES: Except for cities that stand alone in datelines, use the state name in textual material when the city or town is not in the same state as the dateline, or where necessary to avoid confusion: Springfield, Massachusetts , or Springfield, Illinois . Provide a state identification for the city if the story has no dateline, or if the city is not in the same state as the dateline. However, cities that stand alone in datelines may be used alone in stories that have no dateline if no confusion would result. ABBREVIATIONS REQUIRED: Use the state abbreviations listed at the end of this section: In conjunction with the name of a city, town, village or military base in most datelines. See datelines for examples and exceptions for large cities. In lists, agate, tabular material, nonpublishable editor's notes and credit lines. In short-form listings of party affiliation: D-Ala. , R-Mont. See party affiliation entry for details. Following are the state abbreviations, which also appear in the entries for each state (postal code abbreviations in parentheses): Ala. (AL) Md. (MD) N.D. (ND) Ariz. (AZ) Mass. (MA) Okla. (OK) Ark. (AR) Mich. (MI) Ore. (OR) Calif. (CA) Minn. (MN) Pa. (PA) Colo. (CO) Miss. (MS) R.I. (RI) Conn. (CT) Mo. (MO) S.C. (SC) Del. (DE) Mont. (MT) S.D. (SD) Fla. (FL) Neb. (NE) Tenn. (TN) Ga. (GA) Nev. (NV) Vt. (VT) Ill. (IL) N.H. (NH) Va. (VA) Ind. (IN) N.J. (NJ) Wash. (WA) Kan. (KS) N.M. (NM) W.Va. (WV) Ky. (KY) N.Y. (NY) Wis. (WI) La. (LA) N.C. (NC) Wyo. (WY) These are the postal code abbreviations for the eight states that are not abbreviated in datelines or text: AK (Alaska), HI (Hawaii), ID (Idaho), IA (Iowa), ME (Maine), OH (Ohio), TX (Texas), UT (Utah). Also: District of Columbia (DC). Use the two-letter Postal Service abbreviations only with full addresses, including ZIP code. PUNCTUATION: Place one comma between the city and the state name, and another comma after the state name, unless ending a sentence or indicating a dateline: He was traveling from Nashville, Tennessee, to Austin, Texas, en route to his home in Albuquerque, New Mexico. She said Cook County, Illinois, was Mayor Daley's stronghold. HEADLINES: Avoid using state abbreviations in headlines whenever possible. MISCELLANEOUS: Use New York state when necessary to distinguish the state from New York City. Use state of Washington or Washington state within a story when it's necessary to differentiate the state name from the U.S. capital, Washington. It's written Washington, D.C., with the added abbreviation only if the city might be confused with the state."}

Generally, we do not identify people under 18 who are accused of crimes, or transmit images that would reveal their identity. However, managers may authorize exceptions. Considerations in granting exceptions may include the severity of the crime of alleged crime; whether police have formally released the suspect’s name; and whether the person has been formally charged as an adult. Other considerations might include public safety, such as when the youth is the subject of a search; or widespread publication of the suspect’s name, making the identity de facto public knowledge. In some situations, state or national laws may determine whether the person’s name can be published. We normally do not identify, in text or through images, people under 18 who are witnesses to crimes. We also do not identify, in text or through images, people who may have been sexually assaulted (unless they have come forward and voluntarily identified themselves). We should also use discretion in naming victims of other extremely severe abuse.\nSometimes a person may be identified by AP in an abduction or search situation, and it develops later that — because of a sexual assault or other reason — the name should not be used. In such cases we have sometimes refrained from using the identification in future coverage. We do not name suspects or transmit images of them in brief stories about minor crimes when there is little chance AP will cover the case beyond the initial arrest. We also do not link to local stories about such incidents where the arrested person’s name or mug shot might be used. The policy does not apply to serious charges or crimes, such as those involving violence or abuse of the public trust, or cases of a fugitive on the run. See the Criminal Justice chapter."}

{"source_url": "https://www.apstylebook.com/ap_stylebook/hyphen-2", "entry_header": "hyphen (-)", "text_content": "Hyphens are joiners. Use them to avoid ambiguity or to form a single idea from two or more words. Use of the hyphen is far from standardized. It can be a matter of taste, judgment and style sense. Think of hyphens as an aid to readers’ comprehension. If a hyphen makes the meaning clearer, use it. If it just adds clutter and distraction to the sentence, don’t use it. If the sheer number of hyphens in a phrase, or confusion about how to use them, can daunt either the writer or the reader, try rephrasing. It’s a guide about how to use hyphens wisely , not it’s a how-to-use-hyphens-wisely guide . These guidelines include changes in 2019, most notably removal of the requirement to hyphenate most compound modifiers after versions of the verb to be . In addition, see individual entries in this book and Merriam-Webster. AVOID AMBIGUITY: Use a hyphen whenever ambiguity would result if it were omitted. See COMPOUND MODIFIERS section for details. Also: He recovered his health. He re-covered the leaky roof. The story is a re-creation. The park is for recreation. COMPOUND MODIFIERS: When a compound modifier — two or more words that express a single concept — precedes a noun, you must decide: Hyphenate that modifier, or not? Often there’s not one absolute answer. Do use a hyphen if it’s needed to make the meaning clear and avoid unintended meanings: small-business owner, better-qualified candidate, little-known song, French-speaking people, free-thinking philosophy, loose-knit group, low-income workers, never-published guidance, self-driving car, bases-loaded triple, one-way street (Think of the different possible meanings or confusion if the hyphen is removed in each of those examples.) Other two-word terms, particularly those used as nouns, have evolved to be commonly recognized as, in effect, one word. No hyphen is needed when such terms are used as modifiers if the meaning is clear and unambiguous without the hyphen. Examples include third grade teacher, chocolate chip cookie, special effects embellishment, climate change report, public land management, real estate transaction, emergency room visit, cat food bowl, parking lot entrance, national security briefing, computer software maker . Often, arguments for or against a hyphen could be made either way. Again, try to judge what is most clear and logical to the average reader. Also, consult Merriam-Webster. Hyphenate well- combinations before a noun, but not after: a well-known judge , but the judge is well known . Generally, also use a hyphen in modifiers of three or more words: a know-it-all attitude, black-and-white photography, a sink-or-swim moment, a win-at-all-costs approach . Consider carefully, though, before deciding to use more than three modifiers. No hyphen is needed to link a two-word phrase that includes the adverb very and all adverbs ending in -ly : a very good time, an easily remembered rule . Many combinations that are hyphenated before a noun are not hyphenated when they occur after a noun: She works full time. She is well aware of the consequences. The children are soft spoken. The play is second rate. The calendar is up to date. (Guidance changed in 2019 to remove the rule that said to hyphenate following a form of the verb to be .) But use a hyphen if confusion could otherwise result, especially with longer compound modifiers or those that are not as commonly used: The steel surface should be blast-cleaned. The technology is state-of-the-art. The test was multiple choice and fill-in-the-blank. He will work arm-in-arm with the director. Also use hyphens to avoid nonsensical terms such as nonlife : Make it non-life-threatening , not nonlife-threatening . Often the better choice is to rephrase, even if it means using a few more words. COMPOUND VERBS: Don’t use a hyphen in phrasal verbs (a verb combined with an adverb, a preposition or both). It’s back up the car , not back-up the car; set out the desserts , not set-out the desserts . In general, do hyphenate other compound verbs: She speed-walked her way to victory; he spoon-fed the baby . COMPOUND NOUNS: Hyphenate compounds when needed to avoid confusion: merry-go-round, sister-in-law, hand-me-downs, so-and-so . MODIFYING ONE-WORD COMPOUNDS: Words that are usually one-word compounds ( automaker, bookstore ) should be separated when a modifier is added: fast-car maker , not fast carmaker or fast-carmaker . COMPOUND PROPER NOUNS AND ADJECTIVES: A change in 2019: Do not use a hyphen to designate dual heritage: African American, Italian American, Mexican American . PREFIXES AND SUFFIXES: See prefixes and suffixes , and separate entries for the most frequently used prefixes and suffixes. Prefixes that generally require hyphens include self-, all-, ex-, half- . Suffixes that generally require hyphens include -free, -based, -elect . AVOID DUPLICATED VOWELS, TRIPLED CONSONANTS: Examples: anti-intellectual, shell-like . But double-e combinations usually don’t get a hyphen: preempted, reelected . (Exception added in 2019, reflecting common usage.) MULTIPLE COMPOUND MODIFIERS: If the phrase is easily recognized without hyphens, use a hyphen only to link last element: They hope to spark consumer interest in department store-based shopping. She said assistant vice president-managed courses should include real estate licensing-related materials. (Again, rephrasing may be a better option.) SUSPENSIVE HYPHENATION: Use these forms to shorten a compound modifier or a noun phrase that shares a common word: When the elements are joined by and or or , expressing more than one element: 10-, 15- or 20-minute intervals; 5- and 6-year-olds . But: The intervals are 10, 15 or 20 minutes; the children are 5 to 6 years old. When the elements are joined by to or by , expressing a single element: a 10-to-15-year prison term; an 8-by-12-inch pan . But: The prison term is 10 to 15 years; the pan is 8 by 12 inches ."}
{"source_url": "https://www.apstylebook.com/ap_stylebook/comma-2", "entry_header": "comma (,)", "text_content": "The following guidelines treat some of the most frequent questions about the use of commas. Additional guidelines on specialized uses are provided in separate entries such as dates and scores . As with all punctuation, clarity is the biggest rule. If a comma does not help make clear what is being said, it should not be there. If omitting a comma could lead to confusion or misinterpretation, then use the comma. IN A SERIES: Use commas to separate elements in a series, but do not put a comma before the conjunction in most simple series: His grandchildren are Vera, Chuck and Dave. He would nominate Marquez, Bedi, Lyman or Wong. She goes to school, plays league soccer and takes private dance lessons. Include a final comma in a simple series if omitting it could make the meaning unclear. The governor convened his most trusted advisers, economist Olivia Sandler and polling expert Carlton Torres. (If Sandler and Torres are his most trusted advisers, don’t use the final comma.) The governor convened his most trusted advisers, economist Olivia Sandler, and polling expert Carlton Torres. (If the governor is convening unidentified advisers plus Sandler and Torres, the final comma is needed.) Note, though, that rephrasing often is better: The governor convened economist Olivia Sandler and polling expert Carlton Torres, his two most trusted advisers. Or The governor convened his most trusted advisers: economist Olivia Sandler and polling expert Carlton Torres. (If Sandler and Torres are the governor's most trusted advisers.) The governor convened his most trusted advisers, along with economist Olivia Sandler and polling expert Carlton Torres. (If the governor is convening unidentified advisers plus Sandler and Torres.) Put a comma before the concluding conjunction in a series if an integral element of the series requires a conjunction: I had orange juice, toast, and ham and eggs for breakfast. Use a comma also before the concluding conjunction in a complex series of phrases: The main points to consider are whether the athletes are skillful enough to compete, whether they have the stamina to endure the training, and whether they have the proper mental attitude. See dash and semicolon for cases when elements of a series contain internal commas. WITH EQUAL ADJECTIVES: Use commas to separate a series of adjectives equal in rank. If the commas could be replaced by the word and without changing the sense, the adjectives are equal: a thoughtful, precise manner; a dark, dangerous street . Use no comma when the last adjective before a noun outranks its predecessors because it is an integral element of a noun phrase, which is the equivalent of a single noun: a cheap fur coat (the noun phrase is fur coat ); the old oaken bucket; a new, blue spring bonnet . WITH NONESSENTIAL CLAUSES: A nonessential clause must be set off by commas. An essential clause must not be set off from the rest of a sentence by commas. See essential clauses, nonessential clauses in the main section. WITH NONESSENTIAL PHRASES: A nonessential phrase must be set off by commas. An essential phrase must not be set off from the rest of a sentence by commas. See essential phrases, nonessential phrases in the main section. WITH INTRODUCTORY CLAUSES AND PHRASES: A comma is used to separate an introductory clause or phrase from the main clause: When he had tired of the mad pace of New York, he moved to Dubuque. The comma may be omitted after short introductory phrases if no ambiguity would result: During the night he heard many noises. But use the comma if its omission would slow comprehension: On the street below, the curious gathered. WITH CONJUNCTIONS: When a conjunction such as and, but or for links two clauses that could stand alone as separate sentences, use a comma before the conjunction in most cases: She was glad she had looked, for a man was approaching the house. As a rule of thumb, use a comma if the subject of each clause is expressly stated: We are visiting Washington, and we also plan a side trip to Williamsburg. We visited Washington, and our senator greeted us personally. But no comma when the subject of the two clauses is the same and is not repeated in the second: We are visiting Washington and plan to see the White House. The comma may be dropped if two clauses with expressly stated subjects are short. In general, however, favor use of a comma unless a particular literary effect is desired or if it would distort the sense of a sentence. INTRODUCING DIRECT QUOTATIONS: Use a comma to introduce a complete one-sentence quotation within a paragraph: Wallace said, \"She spent six months in Argentina and came back speaking English with a Spanish accent.\" But use a colon to introduce quotations of more than one sentence. See colon . Do not use a comma at the start of an indirect or partial quotation: He said the victory put him \"firmly on the road to a first-ballot nomination.\" BEFORE ATTRIBUTION: Use a comma instead of a period at the end of a quotation that is followed by attribution: \"Write clearly and concisely,\" she said. Do not use a comma, however, if the quoted statement ends with a question mark or exclamation point: \"Why should I?\" he asked. WITH HOMETOWNS AND AGES: Use a comma to set off an individual's hometown when it is placed in apposition to a name (whether of is used or not): Mary Richards, Minneapolis, and Maude Findlay, Tuckahoe, New York, were there. If an individual's age is used, set it off by commas: Maude Findlay, 48, Tuckahoe, New York, was present. WITH PARTY AFFILIATION, ACADEMIC DEGREES, RELIGIOUS AFFILIATIONS: See separate entries under each of these terms. NAMES OF STATES AND NATIONS USED WITH CITY NAMES: His journey will take him from Dublin, Ireland, to Fargo, North Dakota, and back. The Selma, Alabama, group saw the governor. Use parentheses, however, if a state name is inserted within a proper name: The Huntsville (Alabama) Times . WITH YES AND NO: Yes, I will be there. IN DIRECT ADDRESS: Mother, I will be home late. No, sir, I did not take it. SEPARATING SIMILAR WORDS: Use a comma to separate duplicated words that otherwise would be confusing: What the problem is, is not clear. IN LARGE FIGURES: Use a comma for most figures greater than 999. The major exceptions are street addresses ( 1234 Main St. ), broadcast frequencies ( 1460 kilohertz ), room numbers, serial numbers, telephone numbers, and years ( 1876 ). See separate entries under these headings. PLACEMENT WITH QUOTATION MARKS: Commas always go inside quotation marks. WITH FULL DATES: When a phrase refers to a month, day and year, set off the year with a comma: Feb. 14, 2029, is the target date. See semicolon ."}

{"source_url": "https://www.apstylebook.com/ap_stylebook/addiction", "entry_header": "addiction", "text_content": "Addiction is a treatable disease that affects a person’s brain and behavior. Drug and alcohol use can cause changes in the brain that lead to compulsive use, despite damage incurred to a person’s health and relationships. Genetics, mental illness and other factors make certain people susceptible to addiction. Addiction is the preferred term. The term substance use disorder is preferred by some health professionals and is acceptable in some uses, such as in quotations or scientific contexts. Alcoholism is acceptable for addiction to alcohol. Avoid words like abuse or problem in favor of the word use with an appropriate modifier such as risky, unhealthy, excessive or heavy . Misuse is also acceptable. Don’t assume all people who engage in risky use of drugs or alcohol have an addiction. Avoid alcoholic, addict, user and abuser unless individuals prefer those terms for themselves or if they occur in quotations or names of organizations, such as Alcoholics Anonymous. Avoid derogatory terminology such as junkie, drunk or crackhead unless in quotations. Many researchers and organizations, including the Office of National Drug Control Policy and the International Society of Addiction Journal Editors, agree that stigmatizing or punitive-sounding language can be inaccurate by emphasizing the person, not the disease; can be a barrier to seeking treatment; and can prejudice even doctors. Instead, choose phrasing like he was addicted, people with heroin addiction or he used drugs . Examples: Keene had trouble keeping his job because of alcoholism , not Keene had trouble keeping his job because he was an alcoholic . Yang joined other people with heroin addictions at the conference , not Yang joined other heroin addicts at the conference . Avoid describing sobriety as clean unless in quotations, since it implies a previous state of dirtiness instead of disease. Not all compulsive behaviors, including shopping, eating and sex, are considered addictions. Gambling is the only one classified as an addiction in the American Psychiatric Association’s diagnostic manual. The World Health Organization says excessive video gaming can be an addiction. Do not use the terms addiction and dependence interchangeably. Addiction usually refers to a disease or disorder; dependence may not involve one, such as some babies born to mothers who use drugs or cancer patients who take prescribed painkillers. The term misuse can be helpful in cases of legally prescribed medications, such as if a person with a painkiller prescription purposely takes too many to get high, or excessively uses medical marijuana. Such actions do not necessarily entail an addiction but can progress into one. See alcoholic ; diseases ; drugs ; mental illness ; naloxone ; opiate, opioid ; and the Health and Science chapter."}

Though terminology varies from place to place, it's usually best to avoid referring to such proposals as bills , to avoid confusion with higher levels of government. A resolution is a sentiment or recommendation of a lawmaking body, often described as binding or nonbinding depending on whether it has the force of law. Resolutions are adopted or fail . A rule is an authoritative regulation that can be enacted , created or ordered at various levels of government. A statute is a written and enacted law or ordinance . Any of the above terms can also be described generically as measures , provided no confusion would result."}

{"source_url": "https://www.apstylebook.com/ap_stylebook/titles", "entry_header": "titles", "text_content": "In general, confine capitalization to formal titles used directly before an individual's name. The basic guidelines: LOWERCASE: Lowercase and spell out titles when they are not used with an individual's name: The president issued a statement. The pope gave his blessing. Lowercase and spell out titles in constructions that set them off from a name by commas: The vice president, Kamala Harris, was elected in 2020. Pope Francis, the current pope, was born in Argentina. FORMAL TITLES: Capitalize formal titles when they are used immediately before one or more names: Pope Francis , President Joe Biden , Vice Presidents Yukari Nakamura and Vanessa Smith . A formal title generally is one that denotes a scope of authority, professional activity or academic activity: Sen. Catherine Cortez Masto, Dr. Benjamin Spock, retired Gen. Colin Powell . Other titles serve primarily as occupational descriptions: astronaut Sally Ride , poet Maya Angelou . A final determination on whether a title is formal or occupational depends on the practice of the governmental or private organization that confers it. If there is doubt about the status of a title and the practice of the organization cannot be determined, use a construction that sets the name or the title off with commas. ABBREVIATED TITLES: The following formal titles are capitalized and abbreviated as shown when used before a name both inside and outside quotations: Dr. , Gov. , Lt. Gov. , Rep. , Sen. and certain military ranks listed in military titles . All other formal titles are spelled out in all uses. GOVERNMENT OFFICIALS: In stories with U.S. datelines, do not include U.S. before the titles of secretary of state or other government officials, except where necessary for clarity. In stories with international datelines, include U.S. before the titles. ROYAL TITLES: Capitalize king , queen , etc., when used directly before a name. See individual entries and nobility . TITLES OF NOBILITY: Capitalize a full title when it serves as the alternate name for an individual. See nobility . PAST AND FUTURE TITLES: A formal title that an individual formerly held, is about to hold or holds temporarily is capitalized if used before the person's name. But do not capitalize the qualifying word: former Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice , deposed King Constantine , Attorney General-designate Griffin B. Bell , acting Mayor Peter Barry . LONG TITLES: Separate a long title from a name by a construction that requires a comma: Omar Robinson, the undersecretary for economic affairs, spoke. Or: The undersecretary for economic affairs, Omar Robinson, spoke. UNIQUE TITLES: If a title applies only to one person in an organization, insert the word the in a construction that uses commas: Adama Bimou, the deputy vice president, spoke. ADDITIONAL GUIDANCE: Many commonly used titles and occupational descriptions are listed separately in this book, together with guidelines on whether and/or when they are capitalized. In these entries, the phrases before a name or immediately before a name are used to specify that capitalization applies only when a title is not set off from a name by commas. See academic titles ; composition titles ; legislative titles ; military titles ; and religious titles ."}
{"source_url": "https://www.apstylebook.com/ap_stylebook/checklist-for-self-editing-and-for-reporting-and-writing", "entry_header": "Checklist for Self-editing (and for reporting and writing)", "text_content": "Editing involves many skills and considerations, from the basic to the sublime. Let’s look at some of the basics. Depending on the timing and other considerations, addressing each point in this list may be challenging. Remember, though, that the challenges are even bigger if you wait to the end. So, we recommend addressing key points on this list throughout the process of a nonurgent story, and as soon as possible after filing the initial bursts of an urgent story. Such self-editing makes your reporting and writing much stronger before reaching the editor’s desk. It allows more time for attention to nuanced points during later editing. It also can point to the need, sooner rather than later, for additional reporting to answer questions, provide context, fill holes, etc. A special note: With urgent or breaking news — a big fire, a shooting, a major development involving a notable company, the mayor’s resignation — you clearly don’t have time in the early goings to work through each of these points. Once the urgent developments have eased, step back and review the list. Read the story with fresh eyes. Look for ways to improve the copy from that point on. For guidance on broadcast writing , see the broadcast guidelines section of Stylebook Online. GENERAL TIPS Write a 100-word summary, focusing on the absolute need-to-know facts and angles. Then ask yourself: Are those key points clear in the story’s lead, that all-important first paragraph(s)? Are they explained further in a nut graf that summarizes the “so what?” near the top of the piece? Does the story’s focus align with that 100-word summary? Write a draft headline with the same in mind. This also helps you focus the story. Be sure that the headline’s tone matches the story’s tone and that the tone is appropriate for the subject. Read the lead with a fresh eye. Does it invite readers to continue? That applies whether it’s straight news or something more timeless. No wasted words, no irrelevant anecdotes or scene-setters. (Clearly relevant anecdotes or scene-setters can work, if they’re not too long.) Consider your likely audience. How familiar are those readers with this topic? What do they need to know to understand the story? Ask yourself: Does the story make clear what is happening? What does it mean? So what? Who cares? Who is affected, and how and why? From an inclusivity perspective, take a hard look at the text and the visuals — including the sources as well as the angles about who is affected. See the Stylebook’s inclusive storytelling chapter for more details. Aim to get at least two others to read the story: one who’s familiar with the topic, and one who isn’t. What questions do they have? What issues do they spot? (NOTE: Try asking people who aren’t professional writers or editors.) Read the story aloud. This will help you catch sentences that are too long or that don’t read as well as they might. It also should inspire you to edit obtuse prose into conversational language. Change the font and read it again. This may help you spot problems from a new perspective. ACCURACY, ACCURACY, ACCURACY Triple-check all facts, figures, names and titles. Use correct spelling and AP style (both on basic points like punctuation and capitalization, and on big issues such as race-related coverage ; gender, sex and sexual orientation ; disabilities ; immigration, migration ; obesity, obese, overweight ; religion ; technology ; climate change ; criminal justice ; artificial intelligence ; health and science ; polls and surveys , etc.) Be sure that facts needing attribution are attributed clearly, and that the sources providing those facts are in a position to know. A firefighter at the scene can speak knowledgeably about what she saw at that scene. A dispatcher who has heard chatter on the radio cannot. Be sure the reporter can provide sourcing/documentation for every fact in the story, even if that documentation isn’t specified in the story. Ensure that the story is balanced and fair. It gives voice to opposing or varying views at key points of the story (not at the very end). Avoid the “false balance” syndrome — giving a platform to unfounded claims or unqualified sources in the guise of balancing a story by including all views. Listen to warning bells in the back of your mind. Do you sense any little signals that perhaps something isn’t quite right? Pay attention. If you have even a small inkling, check it out. Beware of autocorrect — check to ensure that any words or names with unusual spellings haven’t “helpfully” been changed by technology. CLEAR, DIRECT LANGUAGE Watch for sentences with more than one comma or clause. Especially watch for those with more than two commas or clauses. Consider breaking them into two or more sentences. That helps readability. Also reexamine all dashes and semicolons. Be sure they are used correctly. Often, they are a sign that the sentence should be split into two. Rephrase any cliches, jargon, bureaucratese, journalese. Define terms that could be unfamiliar to your readers. Or reword to use simpler language. Use only the best direct quotations: those that sparkle and that illuminate key points. Don’t use a quotation that just repeats what you’ve already said. Don’t use a quotation when you can paraphrase more clearly and succinctly. Make sure that paraphrases of direct quotations accurately convey the substance and tone of what a speaker said. Use active voice, not passive, in most cases. Use smaller words, not bigger words. Use, not utilize. Try, not attempt or endeavor. Use gender-neutral language: business owner or businessperson, for example; crew, staff, workforce, workers instead of manpower. Use strong verbs. Cut adjectives and adverbs that just add weight without substance. Purge irrelevant details. Use only those that add clarity, perspective or other value. Include enough relevant details to convey the story accurately and vividly. Watch for loaded words or those that could be interpreted differently by different people. For instance, referring to an unarmed Black man or calling someone child-free. ORGANIZATION Be sure that the story is clearly focused and that everything in it supports that focus. Compare again with your 100-word summary. Check the nut graf, generally no lower than the fifth paragraph (often higher). Does it accurately and clearly convey the focus? Consider: What questions would readers have at each point in the story? Do you answer those questions and provide the background and context at logical points? VISUALS Look closely at the photos, videos, interactives or other visuals: Do they work in tandem with the text to convey the story? Are they as strong as they can be? Have you worked with visual editors during the process? Examine the visuals from an inclusivity perspective. See the inclusive storytelling chapter for more details. Read the captions: Is all the information correct and clearly worded, following AP style? Are the key details included? SPECIFIC TOPICS Review these Stylebook chapters if your story covers one of these areas: artificial intelligence ; criminal justice ; business ; technology ; health and science ; climate change ; religion ; polls and surveys ; data journalism ; race-related issues ; gender/sexual orientation ; addiction ; mental illness ; disabilities ; obesity, obese overweight ; suicide ; immigration and migration ; drugs . SOME DEFINITIONS lead : The first paragraph, or sometimes paragraphs, of a story. For hard-news stories, the lead should spell out the essential news point, clearly and concisely, and compel a reader to continue to the rest of the story. It should briefly address some, but not all, of the essential questions: Who? What? When? Where? How? Why? Which of those questions are relevant to a specific lead depends on the story. Don’t try to cram it all into the lead. Some use the spelling lede. At AP, we side with the Poynter Institute’s Roy Peter Clark in viewing lede as jargon-like spelling while lead reminds us to lead readers into the story. nut graf : A paragraph that summarizes key points in greater detail than the lead, and expands with brief answers to some of the other who-what-when-where-how-why questions. You’ll sometimes see the spelling nut graph. At AP, we use graf because we like things short. Some say the term refers to the paragraph’s description of a story’s kernel, or essential elements. It’s also described as “the story in a nutshell.” scene-setter or anecdotal lead : A more gradual approach than a hard-news lead. These can be very effective with compelling, relevant details or a vibrant, relevant anecdote. If done poorly, though, they can bore readers with extraneous verbiage and turn them away."}

Keeping organizations, individuals and their data protected online is an increasingly challenging task that has acquired a specialized vocabulary. Some terms: encryption The mathematical scrambling of messages in order to shield them from unauthorized viewing or modification. Such encrypted messages can typically be read only by the sender and the intended recipient, although in the case of commercial messaging systems, the service provider can often also decrypt and access messages and data such as files, photos or video. end-to-end encryption A way of encrypting messages such that only the sender and recipient can read them. The messaging service does not have the ability to read or modify such messages. That also means it cannot respond to requests from law enforcement; in response, government agencies have been pushing services to create backdoors just for them, though security experts warn that any backdoor for governments could also be exploited by criminals and other parties. Services that offer end-to-end encryption include Signal , Apple's iMessage and Meta Platforms' WhatsApp and Messenger . No encryption method is foolproof, and advances in computing power and cryptographic methods can often unlock messages encrypted by older technologies. Hackers can also sometimes exploit undiscovered bugs in encryption software to illicitly read supposedly secure messages or files. Attackers often break into seemingly secure systems by exploiting vulnerabilities – software or hardware flaws that can be used to bypass security protections. A zero-day vulnerability is such a flaw that has gone undetected by the system's creators and security reviews; explain this term when used in stories for general audiences. malware A general term for software that takes harmful or surreptitious actions, usually to steal data or money, access secure systems, or disrupt organizations. Malware can spread via phishing , \"poisoned\" websites that resemble familiar destinations, apps, or by exploiting vulnerabilities in computer systems. phishing Exploits the trust of users to attack computer systems or to commit fraud by stealing personal information such as credit card numbers, Social Security numbers, user IDs and passwords. The technique typically involves doctored emails often apparently sent by friends, family or co-workers that contain attachments or links to sites that infect a user’s computer with malware. spyware Designed to ransack personal information, track the online activity of individuals, and sometimes to conduct surveillance via device microphones and cameras. ransomware Essentially holds a target computer or computer system hostage by encrypting its files and demanding payment, often via bitcoin. Ransomware can target individuals, businesses and governments alike. denial-of-service attack Entails targeting an internet site with enormous volumes of spurious data traffic. When successful, such attacks can knock a site or service offline until their operators find a way to divert the traffic elsewhere. Sometimes abbreviated DoS , although this shorthand is best avoided. A distributed denial-of-service attack , sometimes abbreviated DDoS , employs a network of distributed computers to direct junk traffic at the target site. botnet A collection of computers infected with malware that can be centrally controlled to conduct cyberattacks. Botnets have been used to carry out denial-of-service attacks, spread malware , send spam and steal data. Botnets can include a variety of devices, from desktop PCs to servers to household smart devices such as internet-connected video cameras. See cyberattack ."}

Anglicans have traditionally considered themselves Catholic, but not Roman Catholic, because they believe they are part of the universal church with their bishops in direct succession from the original apostles. A principal difference between Roman Catholics and Anglicans is still the dispute that led to the formation of the Church of England — refusal to acknowledge that the pope, as bishop of Rome, has ruling authority over other bishops.

Interpretations of these principles vary widely among modern-day Anabaptists in four main movements: traditionalist Amish and Hutterites and the more diverse Brethren and Mennonites , who range from traditionalist to highly assimilated. Conservative Anabaptists sometimes describe themselves as Plain People , marked by separatism from mainstream society and modest, plain dress that includes head coverings for women. The term Anabaptist — originally pejorative but now widely accepted — means rebaptizer because early Anabaptist converts rejected the validity of their baptism as infants in a state church, then underwent baptism as adults when joining the new movement.

Old Order Amish typically worship in homes rather than church buildings and affiliate with one of dozens of networks with differing rules. They attend Amish-run schoolhouses through the eighth grade. In a landmark 1972 case, Wisconsin v. Yoder, the Supreme Court ruled that the state could not require compulsory school attendance among the Amish people past the eighth grade without violating their freedom of religion. A bishop is typically the highest authority in a congregation. As of 2023, there were about 383,000 Amish in the United States and Canada, with the highest concentrations in Pennsylvania, Ohio and Indiana, according to the Young Center for Anabaptist and Pietist Studies at Elizabethtown College in Pennsylvania.

When Christ did not return as predicted, the Millerites split into smaller groups. One, influenced by the visions of Ellen Harmon, later the wife of James White, is the precursor of the Seventh-day Adventist practice today. The term Adventist reflects the belief that a second coming of Christ is near. Seventh-day reflects the church teaching that the Bible requires observing the Sabbath on the seventh day of the week. Baptism, by immersion, is reserved for those old enough to understand its meaning. The head of the General Conference, the top church administrative authority, is the president . Ministers are pastor or elder . Capitalize immediately before a name on first reference. On second reference, use only the last name. The designation the Rev. is not used. See religious titles ."}
